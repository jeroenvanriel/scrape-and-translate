@StephRumm Hopefully we can also vote for party (s) that take corona seriously but are against a coronapas. The current figures teach us that people with a pass also spread the virus.
@Ricardo72929206 @annstrijje You also uh, dirty crook of mine success with further spreading fake news and strength to your child!
@rooswibier @Onair58 Vaccines are less contagious. The chance that they get it and so distribute it is less. They get it less bad, so less pressure on hospitals. Now my son-in-law has to wait for surgery because IC is full of unvaccinated patients.
@VTMNEWS We from toilet duck are....After a week of spraying again in your toilet and some scrubbing... away are all traces from your toilet. Weekly, after week a clean toilet. All year round, lifelong. Just like Phizer vaccine, the glasses of your toilet can spread bacteria and viruses to your guests.
@Kath_74 @Do666999 @WaalsChris @vbemmelj Las last that the ics were full again 134 Corona patients of which 20% vaccinated. So small 100 people of 2million didn't vaccinated on ic. Well, on 2 million people not even noticeably... stop spreading disinformation.
@adegraat @Onair58 @RattusRattus13 Aar unvaccinated people do not enter hospitality, bios etc without negative testing and will not spread there. What vaccinees with a cough can do, especially in poorly ventilated areas without 1.5 meters away...
@WLMD @VvdF020 @mzelst @DiederikJekel If many people don't test, they don't know if they have corona, they probably don't go into isolation and they can continue to spread the virus. Also, there is no source and contact research possible if people don't know that they have corona.
@Elsingh1st @ThomasInLeiden @Diva_sWorld @Poisoni51179073 @deProfessional group @VaxxDoc @Doc_Box No one is a guinea pig, just like all other approved vaccines are the covid vaccines in phase 4. That piece of Twan was dated August 2020. What are you trying to gain by deliberately spreading misinformation? Cui bono?
@ADnl 'Propaganda: a form of communication in which the interested party tries to win supporters for its ideas. By deliberately spreading one-sided and/or invented information, it tries to play public opinion.'
@TrendNederland There are only 32 % vaccinated!!, but you do not answer the fakenews question again, so you acknowledge that FVD-ers are spreading that much.
@DieTukkerfries Then people didn't fly with @transavia to Marrakech to spread the virus
@CarlaWijn Untested vaccinees also exist. In fact, the majority in untested and the variants spread more than unvaccinated because there are more. I do not participate in that witch hunt. Life is full of risks and in my country everyone is entitled to the same care.
@Otualom @TwizS8 @estherouwehand @MinVWS I have lodged a complaint with the Municipality and asked to maintain it. Neighbors are not allowed to spread stench, smoke and soot? @estherouwehand #copd @Longfonds @air fund #open fireplace #allesbrander #unthinking or ordinaryegoistic
It means that the NIS has to stop spreading fake news. It's nothing new, every year since humanity's existence the flu comes up in autumn. https://t.co/rdr0iP8ZDR
@Truesoldier1 @thierrybaudet And quit testing I don't understand, because without testing you don't locate corona and it can spread uninhibited, which also applies to the uncontrolled running of vaccinees and not vaccinees. So what makes sense? (2/2)
@85BossLady ΕΚ Hm. I don't see any difference yet
@JurgenDepoortr @HildeDecleir001 There is still a huge difference I think, wearing a headscarf does not mean that you turn all your lessons into Qur'an lessons, you just teach and you have a head scarf on. Catholic education still obliges you to attend mass celebrations.
@arlennesten @vrtnws Infection vs (breakthrough) infection... is that difference known to you? Only slight symptoms... do you call that a breakthrough infection? The vaccines clearly do their job. Infection happened outside the hospital (may be difficult otherwise considering wearing masks in the ZH).
It was at 20:00 hours 8.7°C degrees, difference last hour: -0.2, rain today: 15.4 mm. For more information about local weather go to https://t.co/AMgqvKv3QC. #lopik #weather #weather

@Advocate_Sent @LeuvenCees id gender makes no difference, however it is necessary that all parties including GI hold it to concrete facts when losing 1 parent, if it can be proven that GI is not right there must be room for parties (showable rebuttal)
@JuliusCoachman Anywhere I go and that misery is on, I turn it off (if necessary) secretly. And there are just people who don't see the difference! I don't understand any of that!
@BrechtDurnez I know there is a difference. Was just a joke.
@doctor_devroey You don't know the difference between a pandemic and an endemic virus?
@NathanSamson1 @mobileevikingsBE @heytelecom_en With orange with difficulty 27 notifications. At Mobile Vikings more than 1,100. Looks like a big difference anyway.
@BjornBon @vanranstmarc @JaapVanDissel Who knows the difference between safety and false safety.
@RRoy9944 What's the difference between a crocodile? How greener how swimmer.
@LauraBromet @RijkJoost @Ruud_Zanders I think the difference is in the interpretation of the news report and thus the placed tweet. Sector approach versus "the farmer" as an individual and as a citizen. https://t.co/7fxDAEiDRY
@HighensWillem @Arnodg @Ruptrs @jpaternotte Ok, we totally agree on that. So it's a sort of "pick and mix"? Pope can't be missed either. The book can't be taken literally either. Is the only difference between us that you believe in a higher power? Can I live as well as you do without believing in him?
@MarionKoopmans Ach, 10 to 15% more contagious, the difference between extremely serious and crushing serious. What the hell, we're not going to do anything about it in the Netherlands. Delicious watching the herd immunity increase rapidly, while vulnerable and elderly, and children become massively ill.
Dear @de_NVA the flemish level, because of your failing Vlareg, does not exist for me. So a federal minister has the right to tap you. As far as I'm concerned, to fire you for not being able. Your ministers prove their incompetence daily.
@HanneloreGoeman @vlaparl @BenWeyts Incompetence of 2 consecutive Flemish ministers for education was enough to ruin everything.
@PynaertP @openvld @Maggie_DeBlock So stupid that she herself comes to highlight her incompetence.
@de_NVA @Yngvild8 A minister is not necessarily an expert, but is surrounded by experts to conduct as good a policy as possible. That one doesn't know that at the n-va we see Weyts, the incompetence that has become fleshy
@thomas_spaas Good that you posted the screenshot. I think it's a nice illustration of Rik Van De Walle's total incompetence to run a big university like the #UGent. What an undersized box glue ball, say!
@lfoquet I like to laugh with the incompetence of the people behind this.
@SincerityFirst @PVissers In my opinion, "the media' criticizes the failure of the government and the incompetence of Broekers Knol and shows that the refugees (e.g. those in Ter Apel) are the victims.
Mss should we start with our Minister of Education @benweyts.. When will this motion of distrust come about now? Rarely so much arrogance and incompetence on such a crucial function united. https://t.co/IEXbmJhSlN

@dbtibet Incompetence squared.
@cuirlaen @jdceulaer @BenWeyts Weytshoort not wrongly fluff his hat, agree. But he is not the incompetence in person responsible for problems in education.who were already current before his arrival. In short, away from the slogans.
A clear warning, but are "powerful lobbying machines, egos, territorial drift, defending the status quo and incompetence among some" another bold act? #covid19 #wave4 https://t.co/VIYAAgyLtN
@PJDeSmedt I have the impression that we will never get rid of the virus with this team, which is really the model of incompetence but which, against will and thanks, keeps the helm cramped, will never get rid of the virus. Vaccines would be the solution and by September everything would be normal.
@IngeMoerenhout "Advanced insight," Inge, not to mention... is typically the greatest euphemism one invokes, rather than "incompetence" or "incompetence".
@jdceulaer @BenWeyts As far as the incompetence of a minister is concerned, we expect a critical attitude from you and your colleagues. However, I do not think you set that bar equally high for everyone.Keeping schools during the pandemic became, and you know that, welcomed by many specialists.

@MarcLongin @GeertNoels @VanDammeEDU One of the main reasons seems to me to be the blurring of standards, the lack of respect and discipline among young people, which causes teachers to lose their grip on students with all the consequences which in the long term will lead to a fallback in enthusiasm for education.
@jpaternotte I just live healthy. It takes a little more perseverance than putting a prick in your arm. I know. The hospitals have been filled with people for 2 years without that discipline and elderly people, both with and without vaccine.
@Aboujahjah Those are rather punitive, dogmatic opinions, based on what...? I just started Elchardus' argument for less (Belgian) political liberalism, and must say, strongly supported by facts and logical analyses. No bad discipline to rationally support punitive language.
@WDooren @jdceulaer Respect and discipline were also invaded. Literally.
@frankhuiskamp Well I had too much time so Hyram's videos went binging and that piece of routine/discipline has stuck.

@demo_demo_nl The poignant thing is that we NL already pay 110mrd direct, 100mrd indirect taxes of 400mrd gross wages, we pay 49mrd care premium. And even then it is not enough according to DNB. NL breaks down tax burden, government attachment to economy is far too big.
@ErikSpierenburg @marckruijtzer @AvHuffelen @MinPress Yes man. The economy is still running well.
@KlaasKnot @WNLOn Sunday And yes, inflation is flying up. Wouldn't you like to settle? Would be so good for the economy. Serious? It's a race to more expensive. Buying power needs to be repaired: benefits, salaries up. Means taxes and products more expensive. Bring everything down!! Better
People whose political education began with their father who is 50% conspiracies spit and 50% pure facts are built different. By the way, 80% of those 50% conspiracies is just shit that the CIA literally recognizes in declassified docs, so not really conspiracies.

@rik_hendriks @ljmzwan @BenserWalt @OBraeckenssieck I do not bagelise anything. Yes, it is terrible for those who have been severely affected. However, we can relate. If you park the emotion and look at the figures, you can see that for this virus, the policy is not right.
What a crazy discussion at @NPORadio1 about the Netflix special by Dave Chappelle, who would be anti-trans or homophobic. Cabaretière who pulls up makes great points, opponent acts purely on emotion. He hasn't even seen the show completely @DitisdeDay @TijsvandenBrink
@wesleychadli @Arnodg @Ruptrs @jpaternotte No: the message is that emotion causes our misery. A pacified, emotionless society is then peaceful. Of course the leadership doesn't stick to it - knowingly - and that leads to the climax.
@JoostNiemoller @Randa1967 Mark means that at most he draws his wallet to take away our tax money from parents' emotions. @MinPress will at most investigate the exact number of the stinger. He is considering whether in 420 cases the removal can be "re-examined."
@dinoroorus @343Sander @Jinek_RTL @PieterOmtzigt He only draws his wallet to take away from our tax money the emotion of parents. He will at most investigate the exact number of the sting.

@IntoBits @parandanah Of course, flirting with danger is often the motivation, and that overlaps with emotion and love. However it may be; in my opinion, she has really lost all credits in her work and her interviews (on paper and spoken). I prefer to see/trust Stoter Boscolo.
@HighensWillem @Arnodg @Ruptrs @jpaternotte Isn't the message there exactly what can happen if you exclude all emotion? Even books, movies, art, etc.? How can a person then come to inhumane acts because of the protocol? A society in Orwellian style?
@matthias_somers Okay, fair enough. But inflation and unemployment have no link. Neither theoretical nor empirical.
@KeesScheepens2 @mariannezw Western science is based on empirical research. They develop and test vaccines on a phenomenon. While in my view man is a holistic being with a mind and a soul. What does a mRNA vaccine do with your brain in the long term? What does it do with your intuition?
@gevaxte @IngeStolkenburg @Mennooje1 @Fridayde13 @GVDBossche Have you also published publications of those who have been reviewed and so on. And also investigated with data (empirical). Or are they just stories of a few who like to chat on youtube?
@nicheje @fzwan @ArieSonneveld To give a good answer to that, I should indicate much more precisely what I mean, in such a way that it is empirical to test: who is "we," what is "visually set," etc.? So for the time being call it an unproven intuition or anecdotal evidence (N=1).
@mvanhout71 @WWieves @GeudensBob @dg_id That's the thing. That empirical research is not conclusive and is often suppressed by practice. There have been many instances of biases in this type of research that are applied unilaterally from the point of origin, where there is no double-blind comparison... ok. You can do this
@Stevenlemmens5 @Wwieves @GeudensBob @dg_id Is also not a question of standing behind anything. It is simply demonstrated in empirical research.
@Jurgenbolscher @LeoPeterzz @ChrisAalberts Your own empirical research is absolutely welcome, as long as you don't talk out of it. Wait I have a nice example:
@ecodenker @LouiseHoon Empirical evidence that free OV would simply lead to sustainable mobility is of course not there, just as there is no empirical evidence that paying or expensive OV would lead to sustainable mobility. That does not exist, because it is not monocausal of course, nobody claims that.
@Public Values Ah, but the SLB is an empirical fact, explainable by the fact that politics is failing. It seems undesirable to me to consider the SLB as a potential policy tool. Then you get professional autocracy (and a lot of randomness).
@AmitBadal Yes. Turns out from years of empirical research.
@Alice_VDE @Annabel57468925 @HoeyberghsJeff Uselessness of CST is both scientifically and empirically proven. Everyone around me is coughing and sneezing. Vaccines and non-vaccines. People are sick. Everyone sees it.
@SachaDierckx @LouiseHoon Modal shift is id crucial, focusing on more quality of life. What I miss in your speech is referring to empirical material. That's why I asked the question if there's one in front of frontrunners in terms of sustainable mobility in the EU with free public transport. I didn't think so.
@OM_OostNL Is there static or empirical research that shows that applying fast-track law helps to prevent new offences of equal order?
@harmbeterema @D66 @MinOCW @ivanengelshoven By the way, empirical research shows that the biggest diversity gap in academia (in the EU) is not between black and white, Christian-Muslim, native-allochtoon or male-woman but between left-right. Also a quota for right-wing academics?

@roos_zitman @RandySnoyl @SylvanaBIJ1 @lientje1967 The Scandinavian countries prove that women make different choices, there is more equality and freedom of choice, and yet women there still opt for women's professions more than anywhere else. Equal outcomes are utopian thinking, which is the point where left has flown off the bend..

@roos_zitman @RandySnoyl @SylvanaBIJ1 @lientje1967 The crux is humanity yes. Once we had no fire and were prey animals, man and woman have managed to grab it up to here. Nice piece of cooperation. Current equality bullshit is calling for preferential treatment..
@Annelieseken 35€ and tell him not to keep a girlfriend free. Message to my daughter was: pay yourself, boys don't get double pocket money.#equality
And implying that women cannot make that choice themselves is the opposite of equality
@EinsteinBarbie Are mandatory quotas (equality) in RvC and RvB equality?
@VincentVQ Democracy has its flaws. Absolute equality, nor absolute freedom are utopia. But in times of crisis, the adherents of totalitarianism are bursting into the hole. Let us control more freedom to bring more equality. Until the people say again: ENJOY!
@SchoutenLegal What is a well-functioning society? Is that a society where everyone feels equally comfortable and well-known?Is that financial equality? What is the role of government in this society? Is there a government that is equally trusted by everyone?I like to hear it
@LeendersGeert @DusauchoitChris @walterpauli @biekepurnelle You know that a female imam nt can pay with the death penalty. However, she stands for everything a modern Islam could be: equality, everyone welcomes LGTBQ as well. Why doesn't one put energy into this but in that headscarf?
@thijs_smeenk Ah what good to hear Thijs! Thank you! I continue to follow your efforts for more equality with admiration - and your other work as well. We speak!
In the name of 'equality' they then ensure that women, who want to give them more opportunities, simply don't get the opportunities others get because they have a different belief, something that doesn't matter at all if you give mathematics or something.
@anymorebrol So I don't get this? Equality for men and women but women shouldn't wear headscarf as a sign of religion that means a lot to them and what they often choose for themselves? Then it's no longer equality, kids, it's not that hard
We had a Youca day at school today and a man came to talk about discrimination, equality, racism, homophobia... What ironic, people come to school to tell us how to accept everyone, while they still don't accept girls with headscarf?
@EinsteinBarbie In compulsory education, equality and neutrality is more than desirable. So yes: no political, ideological or philosophical signs in compulsory education. As far as higher education is concerned: freedom &amp; happiness about your beliefs.
@geertwilderspvv I knew it! why do they never say the ethnicity of the perpetrators? to give right populist flank no confirmation? but we have the right to know who always does all this misery in our society 90% of migrants are men between 18~30 vol=full
@satefuta @NOS Now without typos: There is no connection between ethnicity and crime all that is wrong is your confirmation bias.
@RoelJennissen @irene_earshot When we throw it over that bow, I would like to add that I find it problematic that a new classification is sent into the world without it being based in the mountain on scientific research on conceptual entanglement of culture, language, ethnicity &amp; race
Racism is all the more reprehensible when Surinames or Moluccans etc are mistaken in the ethnicity of a Dutchman who is of mixed origin but is seen as white and is judged only on his skin color. Racists are everywhere
@roachnat1on Arabs is ethnicity treasure, you have white, brown, black, all diverse, so you're just white just not European white, white is wider than tattas, Asians can also be just white but of course with other features
@V_iswaker If there were to be an investigation into natonality or ethnicity of the people who come to the hospital with complaints...But there is not.
@jangajentan But the Azan shudders through the streets and the @police is mainly after 1 ethnicity. In the past luck was very common.

We want real diversity and that's why we have to pressure or deport people who have different ethnicities to another country. #Article23 Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Some do accept this logic when it comes to schools and modes. #Article23
@HistoricalNwsbl This is easy to trace from Das Kapital, but that text is certainly too complicated for Slaa, who reveals his obsession with ethnicity when he tries to analyze Zur Judenvrage. It is about capitalism as a religion in a secularising culture.

@DongaMaurits @PHB736 @NOS With regard to the transgender story, these so-called 'transrights' are directly against women's rights. They affect women's sports, they demand access to protected areas for women, and they claim prizes for women. It's anti-feminism.
@LeendersGeert @DusauchoitChris @walterpauli @biekepurnelle No, answer me now. And tell me why a female imam (who fights for feminism and equality between men and women) has a fatwa on her head?
Do you remember that Fransico of Jole (@2525) committed a #metoo and shortly afterwards was allowed to lead a debate about feminism (the organization saw no objection)? Why is his career not destroyed and he still gets a stage? Oh wait, he is left. https://t.co/1qYXTyYL7F
@TiliaVulgaris @Absolute Fascism and Feminism - they are all just perspectives with an equal claim to the truth. We only get further when we embrace this valuelessness. Individual perception should become the guiding principle of all things.

@BedrijvigeSaiga @SvenDeLoenen Thinking is too hard for people who only get their "education" from 1 particular environment. Then tell me why women do not claim their place within Islam? If the battle is about the headscarf in the outside world then they don't have time for feminism within Islam.
@Elvengast @jjvpeperstraten Self-initiation witchcraft is eclectic witchcraft, the oldest form of witchcraft. But Susan Smit has not initiated himself. That ecology has its roots in national socialism is bullshit. And what is the objection to modern influence edn asls feminism?That was badly needed
@SvenDeLoenen @BedrijvigeSaiga I also find it rather special that when I ask about feminism within Islam where women claim their rightful place next to the man in the mosque, I usually get blocked.
@Sanspareille @jjvpeperstraten Self-initiation* witchcraft, and there the argument starts to fall apart. The reason that these two nowhere find traction is because they do not exist in history. Ecology has its origin in national-socialism, feminism is another recent phenomenon.
@Elvengast @jjvpeperstraten Firstly, she is not a Wiccan following me, secondly, the initiation witchcraft really cannot be described as Cult of the Self. All religion or philosophy cherrypicks its way through spiritual history, most avoid feminism and ecology and that is a pity.
@Sanspareille @jjvpeperstraten Wicca is not a tradition but a New Age mishap from 1954, strewn with modern ideas such as feminism and ecology. It wishes itself a mystery cult, but cherrypicks its way through all kinds of historical traditions for legitimacy.
@anders_thinking @Elvengast @jjvpepperstraten Teresa even writes that unity can only be obtained by being in a state of grace through sacraments. I almost bet that these two have become popular in modern times because of a projected "feminism," "rebel against authority," and so on.

@brunostruys If you prefer your religion to a job, then you don't belong to the class! What's next? All women veil? How deep do you want to bow down to religious fundamentalism?
@biekepurnelle So they know what they're talking about...religious fundamentalism has no place in education
@brecht_jonkers @fonskedespons @brunostruys Nothing to do with fundamentalism? Is anyone who sees a barrier to accepting a job as a teacher rather than being open-minded or what? This has everything to do with Islamic fundamentalism.
@brecht_jonkers @brunostruys This has everything to do with fundamentalism. Someone who considers medieval, discriminatory, religious symbolism more important than a job in education has the wrong priorities and is unfit as a teacher.
@fonskedespons @brunostruys This has nothing to do with fundamentalism.
@biekepurnelle What a downright ridicul argument. It's not because we tolerated that 50 years ago that we have to do that today too. Whoever thinks a religious symbol is more important than a neutrality principle does not belong to a class. Religious fundamentalism can be missed as the plague.
@brunostruys If those ladies are eager to teach, then it shouldn't be a problem to respect the principle of neutrality? If they think that religious symbol is more important, then they should stay out of our classes. Religious fundamentalism can be missed as the plague.

@meralx @radio1be Hopefully never headscarfs in class. It starts with a headscarf and ends with the decapitation of another non-Muslim teacher. Have we really forgotten Samuel Paty? Let's never accept expressions of Muslim fundamentalism in our Western schools
@JuulBruijnincx @SalimaBelhaj A Muslim does not see that Islam is structuralally a religion that is an excellent breeding ground for fundamentalism. Catholics were also told during the Enlightenment that from now on Church and State were separated. Refugees think of themselves.
@RobbinHelmond Well actually I don't think it's even per se, but it's done out of Islamist fundamentalism (your attached icons), that's totally out of the question for me.
@RobbinHelmond The content of yours also escapes me. Something with'religious fundamentalism that leads to misery', you seem to aim at. That in the second picture of you is thus already not the case. In which the comparison with the first picture also goes a long way.v

@MichelleKuppens @Deniece_is_free @JoostNiemoller Actually, Michelle, you say that a woman comes out that she is a lesbian (or a man gay) this is not a tradition.... The tradition was denial and marrying to another sex. Also nostalgia and continuity disappears because people can and may be themselves. &gt;&gt;
Gay. Gay. Lesbian. Pot. I'm with everyone. And you? https://t.co/3eW0WgcjZX
@backvolgjake @Mocking93504540 ALLÉN the best should get n function,NIÉT because t n man,wife,gender,gay, lesbian,transsexual...and what seems to be even more of genders. Oh, I forget n Enuch...maw: ALLÉN the best, yet Jake, I agree with him...
@TheRightNL Are there any superheroes at this time who just have a fat... and just want a hot bitch......? Why all at once Gay, Lesbian or Bi?
@hanslaroes Well, it's not about her personally, it's about the law, about equal treatment of homosexuals. The king or queen should also be just gay or lesbian without having to abdicate thrones. It's relevant now because she's turning 18 and theoretically allowed to marry.
@KShithol @Ernie77354384 @markrutte Why do you call that 'frames'? There's nothing wrong with being a lesbian at all? I don't know if she's a lesbian, but why would she care and why would she be bullied? And I have shit on Rutte, but if he's asexual or gay, isn't that great?
@CieltjeVachter @de_NVA Curious whether Defi and MR dare to vote. In this one I am not blind to threatening relocation to France of halal millions of slaughter industry in our city.

@switchinblades @Marcel4X @greenlinks Well, I'll give you the right one time there may be someone whose gender may not be directly visible, but this is really rare. Men and women really have enough external characteristics outside of genitals in which you can distinguish them.
"Bitches' means no respect for the female sex......- https://t.co/HXERWJEvej
@mwillemsen27 @Marcel4X @greenlinks You don't even know everyone's gender so you just say what you think is right and if someone corrects you then it's really no trouble to adjust the ff.
@HananeDeVos @godmiljaarde First sex and then drowned in that water sauce
@BabesNassira Have t really about simple things like, carrying gold etc that does vary by gender
@JanWillemFeith Yes. The straights who do not doubt their own gender or orientation.
@BennyBrodala @petervdv21 @jan_dhaene Sweetheart? Sorry no interest in other men. And if I'm interested in the same sex I certainly wouldn't like bitch types like you. Sure that booster shots are good for you, I'm counting on you to keep taking them!Good stuff according to the drug dealers.
@Sxlmaa_x What sins differ by gender?
@switchinblades @Marcel4X @greenlinks No because bass is a name it says nothing about someone's gender. And you can just change your name but then your genetic format will remain the same and you're still a man.
@PVerijke @Piet25051963 @akbaspinar I do not fight for religious symbols, I expect people to be treated equally regardless of their beliefs, gender, sexual preference, etc. Neutrality is cheap excuse not to do so. That's all.
E.g. if a woman listens to music or does not dress properly and a man also listens music and does not dress properly, they are both wrong. Both commit the same sin. The woman's sin is not worse because she is a woman? (And yes some sins differ is sex Iknow)

@fransjackson @HaexMireille @klipc @margabult @mkulemans @volkskrant I don't come across the word mrna vaccine here. Furthermore, gene therapy doesn't involve the human gene. Genetically modified sunflowers also fall under gene therapy
@blckbxnews It's definitely about the syringe. It's a mRNA gene. Genetically modified gene therapy. mRNA gene in nanobots. mNRA that converts into DNA and attaches itself to our own DNA. A kind of Monsanto hassle but on the human race. That's definitely what it's about.

@Claudje1234 @Diaantjebvv I agree that not everything is going as smoothly for everyone, but if I may believe our ancestors, it used to be more financially embarrassing. The younger generation is hardened mainly by means like mobile devices icm social media.
@keusmark @MinVWS have been vaccinated polio is as good as thrown out because people like me have taken the vaccine for it, many diseases that were deadly by my generation and older have been thrown out because WE have protected you and future generations by vaccinating us
@Krid_Voices Exactly! Building sufficient generation-4 nuclear power plants seems to be a better option.
@keusmark @MinVWS believing does??? what..and in the back will it be worth? because someone says that maybe and that even without siege says "the vaccine is going to kill you if not right then later" you don't have to have smallpox vaccine because I and many other of my generation are against us

@Martijn_Hofman @BartNijman No. It's why everything goes wrong in NL. Focus Rutte has been on pro EU enlargement, pro Immigration, pro Globalisation and now Climate. The basic agenda vd EU. Against the will of NL majority. Hence that all-destructive coalition compulsion. 30% benefits 70% is the shaak.
@JolandaVlaskamp Look at England what happens when you depend on globalisation for your supply chain. However, we also build the Netherlands and drive away the farmer. An electorate that is just as fragmented as the politics that governs a club of impenetrables in Brussels.
@JanLatten Globalisation has gotten the whole world mixed. You can NEVER reverse that anymore. With fear spreading and dividing in us and them, you don't solve anything. On the contrary, there needs to be a common perspective. Through the migrants can also develop poor countries, that damps population growth.
@NPORadio1 @2525 @de nieuwsbv What a crazy person. These kind of characters should be baked for life. - Fucking Christian? - Do they all want to die? - A gift from God? Is this an NSB-er or? Or just someone from the left......who has no idea of globalisation and resources.
@hollandswiefke @umarebru Truth finding is no longer necessary if you are npo, because you believe everything that has stopped globalisation in Rutte and Hugo to indoctrinate us and cheat #npo is #cheaters #mediavirus
@finhstamsterdam Noorlander forgets that as a NPO journalist he has a duty to inform citizens exactly what parties stand for. And not only to promote the same agenda as Coalition Rutte, nml pro EU, pro Climate, pro Immigration and pro Globalisation. Because that's what Noorlander does.
@Hvbt36Henny @huybertt @ErdalBalci9 It's a unique, unprecedented situation. But it's also a unique time. Globalisation, information speed, everyone knows what's happening on the other side of the world, everyone travels around the world, everyone can reach anyone: that was really different 20 years ago.

That buffer strategy in crisis management is, I think, a crucial element of his teflon layer. The first blow is rarely taken by himself, regardless of the seriousness of the mistakes made by the government. Rutte is not seen again until the worst thunderstorm is over.
@Frans_Strik @NPO1 By "unimportant details," I mean that our government and apparently an important part of the 2nd room find this... they let these people in massively. Or I misunderstand your last remark...

My wife, with about 25 cousins and cousins, gets a small inheritance from Canada by means of a #cheque. Since this year you can't cash cheques in the whole of the Netherlands.

@JaronBlonk Jaron, you also mentioned/named of the Beek absolute world top. Think that your objectivity when it comes to (ex) Ajax players is as high as that of Neal with the Dutch Junior players who once entered the show. Small tip; Not present.
@CarijnB @roelgrif @jongs107wxsnl1 @JosetteSchoenma @MarionKoopmans Yes, that is better. I would like to add: by exceptionalism, orientalism etc.

@RoelofBouwman @wiepau would never be able to cope with the circumstances in which @geertwilderspvvv has been living for years. He is not afraid, he simply doesn't romanticize a totalitarian religion, but unfortunately the orientalism of @D66 and @SigridKaag has no boundaries. #regressive links
It has everything you expect. Mystery, Orientalism, the erotization of non-Western women and racial stereotypes. Not strange of course for a comic strip printed in 1968. https://t.co/GirEsZ5zTj
The latest Magazine Oud-Utrecht is dedicated to themes such as slavery, colonialism, orientalism and voyages of discovery, partly following the recent book 'Slavery and the City of Utrecht' (1/2) https://t.co/1Rd8hORGu4
Rituals is like the Disney ficturing of Orientalism, for people who put buddha statues in their garden and windowsill, who walk in purple harem pants through Thailand and harass everyone with their selfie stick, who once in a while yell "sushi-time!"
@keesjan @volkskrant Oh yes here you have glass ceilings and 'white men' but to Afghanistan 'don't look with western eyes' of course. No orientalism but racism of low expectations.
De Volkskrant does not notice that people are being hanged on the assembly line and talks about Western world problems in Afghanistan... Orientalism much? https://t.co/cJdWEy68J5
@MylanPiron @ManuelSintubin @NoelSnakes @iaeaorg @RosatomGlobal @FortumNuclear And even RMBK reactors didn't hang "with stick and spit together." The piece of Mr. @noel snakes doesn't seem to me to be confused with orientalism and the obligatory East Bloclichés.

That means that you know someone who got a heart attack after vaccination is super normal. But 'after' is something other than 'by'.
@stridjestrijp @NicoleGiroldi @CornelisRobertu Now I've just put it right, so what you're talking about doesn't apply to me. I'm just going from the evidence from always. And just like now I see that it was different from what I said and I'll come back to that!

@Walrathis The total number from home placements is 40,000, there is much more in self-reliance and participation that is not right. The protest parties are not a solution there are politicians who do do the word people but have nothing else to do with it.

@PieterOmtzigt Dear Mr Omtzigt, the virus is not a lot more deadly than the flu, but I agree with you. Join the 'extremists' who fight the policy on a scientific and legal basis. Look at The New World and Maurice.
@Assita_Kanko I don't think it's a good idea to base our policy on the opinion of women in Afghanistan. Ask the Belgian women. There's plenty of veiled women in there.
@pretfles @ABynens @MichaelDeBoey93 Can't imagine that you can justify the policy and this system or even exalt. Belgium is really a failed state... and those who deny it or don't see it have insufficient information, I'm afraid.
Open Vld and CD &amp; V are questioning the credibility of the vaccines. Politically questionable, unworthy policy on tv
@Benavra No, in Rutte's hardline BV Nederland policy the words'management', 'consultant','marketing' and 'toolbox' are very common. Ask his advisor Ben Verwaayen.
It's time for a fair policy for everyone.
@sumixamxefitnop That a zero covid policy doesn't work, that the measures don't work (never worked), that the vaccines don't work... that we've been lied to by politicians and virologists for almost 2 years! That this isn't about health but about CONTROL!
@PieterLdeWolf Farmers are looking for a long-term vision, perspective and consistent policy. Without a dot on the horizon and annually changing policies, billions are being destroyed for what?? The whims of politics?? For fun??

If the right-wing people who complain about political correctness were consistent, they would be more terrified by PC culture surrounding the police (the people who are authorized to carry out violence on behalf of the state) and how they should always be treated with children's gloves.

@SonjaDahlmans @demo_demo_nl The whole postmodernism revolves around the absence of objective facts.
There is about that, namely the majority of the world (non-Christian). The Enlightenment took refuge in reason. We have for a hundred years (secular) philosophers who notice that objective morality does not exist (postmodernism). Why do you stay in the 19th century? https://t.co/beXutE4PzV

In our rich country more than 250,000 (!) children grow up in poverty. This has huge impact. Often a lifetime. Yes, the responsibility lies largely in The Hague. However, public pressure can help. Therefore, sign this petition from @stichtingSIRE &gt; https://t.co/vj05972MS3
Toes Curving #DealOrNoDeal and that bad acting presentation thing from Buddy. But poverty trumps at @RTL5 if you have to broadcast 2 hours every night! to this shit. Nomination worth #tvKnol
If you really don't want children to be taken away just like aboriginals and Indians, always vote SP or something you're quite sure of. #children of the tax service could have happened because discrimination in NL has moved to discrimination initiation of poverty.
@HenkSpaan9 Left-intellectual (if you can already say so in football) shows information poverty with these sandbox changes. Read nothing content or any debate-worthy in between. Level angry baby boomers who like to leak your football.
Enough to get rid of the rule of law. Enough to destroy lives of 10 thousands of families and children. #Extra charge scandal Enough to rob millions of elderly people of decent old age. #Retirement robbery. Many hundreds of thousands further into #poverty. Only one #Rutte https://t.co/XGGTUqXZIE
@iNtRoVeRt_Ed @green @Ecolo @vooruit_nu @PSofficial Poverty? Do you mean that half a million children have no roof over their heads and no food? I don't think you know what real poverty is. Moreover, families sometimes choose a difficult situation when they decide to bring 4 children into the world.
@Roysmid72 I would like to see Dessers to bring in his duel power, Nelson is TOP for me too!
@hugodyoungie THE SUCCESS OF A VACCINATION SHOULD NOT DEPEND TO PEOPLE WHO DO NOT TAKE HIM. YOU ARE A DEMOON IN A LOW TRILLING AND THE TIME IS FOR LEUGERS AS YOU. IF YOU TAKE THE VACCIN YOUR POWER WILL GO. IS FOR CONTROL AND NOT MORE FOR CARE.
It is to everyone's advantage to quickly learn to spread language with metaphor to strengthen it, because intention and facts don't matter anymore when the feelings come. It's no less wok because you suddenly take it up for Christians. https://t.co/FrC7FAsxB3
@normal01 @2525 @gertjansegers @denewsbv I already have a lot of it but I thank you for it because I don't trust it by the way nothing to do with my faith purely with mind, I'm glad I get to make that choice myself, by the way I'm now recovering from corona where I just come through on my own strength
@bolhuis_a @FiliaVeritas @gherusselman @thierrybaudet So once. Also Baudet can grow in here, because he often gives one a stick to beat with and loses his strength. His interviews with e.g. Jorn Luka, or with Faya Lourens show the man behind the puppet show. And he could count on much more empathy..

@Jacoba_ @kamstra_raymond Meh, a bit of sand. Filters let sand shine. Gives a nice soft image.
@rudybouma @Nieuwsuur @MarcBonten Yes, it was an investigation last year but don't assume they were lying. But we have to get to medication now the vaccines are losing power in time so where do all those tests stay? I would prefer a pill if I get sick rather than always pricking.

@PoliticsRealist But do you see that the power of heterologous vaccinations doesn't only apply to primer/vector + booster/mrna? It also works with mrna + mrna. Was the Netherlands also very slowly along with that heterologous vaccination, and it still doesn't work. "Really fast as we can." https://t.co/d1lwFfX5B2

@Sonja89688144 Awfully sad, a lot of strength and strength desired.
This article in last Saturday's @volkskrant shows how empty the liberal pragmatism of the VVD is. Quote from @TonElias says everything: "The @VVD only has Rutte, Rutte and Rutte'. There is zero content and that radiates from the Netherlands. https://t.co/mfDHHZArrh
@remcodb @mathijsbouman All entrance and lack of pragmatism of @Joris_PvdA does not benefit consistency.
@PvdA is for and against CCS, who gets that. That's not so hard; @joris_pvda is in the wrong party. His visionary idealism doesn't fit well with the pragmatism of the @pvda, and he sews his own seam. https://t.co/NHA1j7UPAH #FD #Environment #Climate
@Boreout Haha, so I hadn't looked at it yet.
@peter_mertens Another proof that social dialogue in this country is dead. A consequence of the rigid attitude of the social partners, who no longer give each other a penny. Zero pragmatism, only dogmatic ideology.
Two thirds of the Netherlands are covered with green asphalt. And we let that happen. Industrial thinking, pragmatism and efficiency form a toxic mixture that has largely driven nature out. https://t.co/u5YsPQ8KAN
@sentgood @noorlanderarjan Pragmatism, realism and idealism are more necessary than opportunism. What would that circle look like?
@kimvankeken @JanDriessen @HumbertoRTL @HumbertoTan Indeed. We in Brabant had to pay particular attention to the reasonableness of the members of the States concerned. Thus the CDA stated. These do not compare with their relatives in The Hague. Lamekoek! Wrong pragmatism! Stay true to your values and norms. They are not interchangeable!
The kind of pragmatism that many anti-vax Christians could learn from.
@JDSchoolmeester Just at @CanaalZCanalZ, we've been looking at the explanation of @Zu_Demir who is just starting from pragmatism (so realism). Think that Green and CDenV aren't going to make it anymore. If you're driving in the wrong direction for an hour, you'll always have to return for an hour and you'll lose 2 hours.
@Poethiek Ah there is so much going on. Some pragmatism suits me well!
@GeertjeDekkers And @susansmitteur talks nonsense, with her 'first feminists': in a world where no 'house doctors' were found in a community, everyone with knowledge of medicine, in any way, was indispensable. Had NOTHING to do with feminism, but with pragmatism.
@shossontwits Sander, in almost all healthcare sector Dutch pragmatism has disappeared. MBO 3 for helping with support stockings is idiotic. And in corona: why not prophylaxis and early treatment with melatonin and ivermectin? Are detectable replicase inhibitors! So yes, you get a #care infarction

@BertilFolkers @NancyGroningen In our municipality the municipal gardens and other public greenery are maintained by private Hoveniers. And they are well paid for that. Firefighter has something better to do.

@vanranstmarc In my neighborhood everyone wears a mask in shops and public transport.
@marijn_stool @NOSWaagmeester @DeGroene A fantastic article that shows how extremism gets a chance when the government withdraws and neglects its job in the social domain giving extremism an opportunity; the importance of public education. Ergo: A strong social government and abolishing Article 23?
@isabelledepoor1 @tscheldt I wonder more, how hopeless can you be to muzzle with den #egbert, and still in public
@unfortunately I don't mind that you're pissing but please do so in your own bedroom and not in public
@RobinVA6 And then you forget that they are mandatory on public transport, hospitals and that many still wear them, especially vulnerable people. I wear them daily as a doctor. You can also put that in your calculus.

@OmeWillemsatire Sorry I haven't succeeded. Wouldn't be quiet if they don't pay taxes anymore. No public transport, no petrol, no shop/horeca, no pay slip, no gas, water and light. Don't they receive anymore? Rent subsidy, care allowance, child benefit, etc. https://t.co/l8vZBu5vQw
@Anarchazazel @RubenBaetens The intention of the #km tax is not necessarily extra taxes, but a steering and fairer tax shift (from tax to modulated mileage tax). This should also be allowed for public transport: during rush hours it may be more expensive (e.g. in London).
@dutchanddonts Indeed, it is a kind of tribal hypnosis created by (irrational) fear. If you do not participate in the'sacrifice', then you are a freak. The 'irony' is that rational thinking is precisely in the collective individual interest, namely, freedom and justice.
Ricin is a poisonous protein that can cause breathing difficulties and eventually death. Why do they do something so dangerous in a vaccine? That's very strange, strange and worrying.
@Chiisuigintou @VTMNEWS No one, but you are viewed as a freak when you wear one (not me that cares)
@Jan_Slagter Zuidling that someone who does not know the facts invokes facts.
@KleberMatte @Maurice23049240 @rudybouma Wappie is a pejorative concept that originated in the Dutch language in the nineties of the twentieth century. It indicates a strange state of mind where one has lost one's way, or a strange person, a wandering ghost or 'crazy'.
And number 11. That's kind of a freak thing, by the way.
@njmidm @thierrybaudet And when corona exploded in all intensity he pleaded for swift lifting measures.
@zeemaar_LydeLa Are it predictions or long prepared by this mega-rich freak with a preference for artificial population control. Also called eugenics.
@budgetary sustainability @dreoudman That part of your opinion isn't crazy as far as I'm concerned. That's different from your earlier wording, which would have the effect that private property should actually automatically transfer into public possession du_moment e&amp;a if rented accommodation is made suitable.
@budgetary sustainability @dreoudman 't Isn't it about what I/others deserve, but about what you would have to give up because of a (other) moral dogma as soon as you wanted to rent it as a living space. That would be different if you rejected all private (own) property as immoral anyway.
Within 20 years, communion parties are taboo and Spring Festivals are freaky. The new thing becomes a gender party. Probably every 10 years. I want to be a boy between 10 and 20, I want to be a woman between 21 and 30, then I want to be a man again. Maybe we can lease names or something.

@IkJust79 That's part of the explanation given to me by my doctor to encourage you not to take the vaccine for the time being. There's also good information about it and the reason why the package leaflets still state that you shouldn't take the vaccine in case of allergy.
@arantxavheinde That's dirty yes... and reason to divorce.
@TunnelForce9 @AnoMientje01 @Carina_mareloca It is clear that vaccines do help. But if I understand you correctly, are you referring to, for example, the expected flu wave?

@SimonsMario44 @standard What does neo-communistism mean? In practice, this was expressed in a policy that focused more on social reform than revolution and willingness to compromise with non-communist political parties. Outside Western Europe it is sometimes referred to as "neocommunistism."
@LinksFlemish Ah, but that's the flag that was used during the 1830s revolution. I thought: that's what we need back, drastic reform and revival.
@dimgrr It is part of the ambition to confer on the government a "essential' (propaganda for "totalitarian') role, so that citizens are fully governed and controlled "a self-created' condition for reform of society and introduction of the 4th Industr. Revolution.
The way Europe works with us as the biggest net payer is impossible, and without it it is not smart because China sees Russia as a danger for Europe, and with it our freedom too. Revolution and reform of the EU is needed so that we are safe together, but otherwise it will not work now!
@kvdbroec @IMFNews Reform from above to avoid revolution from below. At the IMF they realize that the stability of the system may be compromised, and then the profits will be over.
@GillardRobin @radioboiling point both reform and revolution are needed. Even though parties like the CPN have achieved little to nothing in terms of laws, they have moved people to the left, and parties like the PvdA have built the care state with prime ministers like Drees and den Uyl.
@2deRoomFVD That German blood flows where it cannot go. If there is an anarchy, revolution and reform taking place, I think it is also time for another national anthem.
@Rombrecht Banking and stock market supervision, a reform of agriculture and the use of the unemployed to work on all kinds of public buildings and projects, just as Wolff says... and funded by companies and rich people. That's not protecting but it's not revolution either.

@KingEdwin70 Terminal relativism because you've identified yourself too much with your ideas. It would be nice if we saw the positive effect of it, but that doesn't seem to be there.
@roelsint @kayotickitchen @jochemwesterhof The point of discussion is not that oppressive religious fundamentalism in reformatorial circles should be spared, but that it is inconsistent to do so, while much more virulent problems in Islam are spoken up under the guise of cultural relativism.

@mariusschoenma2 @Cornelis_ @NOS On the contrary, God of the Bible blesses me that despite the secular madness and normalized perversion of the modern world I still remain faithful to Him. You obviously follow the devil as you are in favour of moral relativism and soulless hedonism.

@NOS The virus gets the chance to mutate in vaccinated people, stop that vaccination and let us resist the work
@fatihbaey Types of and was clear at the time. The coronavirus is new and several variants of it have been added; now there is a doubt about a new variant again. My point is that certainty on resistance to corona is more limited with a new vaccine..2)
@nienewoud @dancalegria Same goes for Aspergillosis, this fungus occurs almost everywhere and is harmless to healthy people but can be dangerous to people with reduced resistance. Don't know where he thinks his mouth is but Amoeben lives in the colon.

@dvhn_nl The wonderphrase: "If that helps to contain Covid" It doesn't help, that's the whole point!! If we have to mass up to the Pampers I would do that if it helped. BUT IT DOES NOT HELP!! Stronger, bad for your resistance...
@Sabje1979 @faith Just make sure that children build up resistance and eat healthier food instead of leaking them. I can't believe the fear of some people, how is that possible?!
@EelcoHoecke is also unnecessary, only in case of severely reduced resistance. But there is more going on. Every news broadcast you hear more beat-up stories about increasing infections. That beat up my new variant, is meant to persuade vaccine refusers. More than 82% has already been vaccinated!

@TruthRaider1 @Irisblossoms But there is very little resistance in the real world. On Twitter you would believe (and hope) that it is different, but look around you! Fear is the ultimate influence agent. The goedemunicipality is like wax in their hands. And I don't have a good word left for it.
@AlwinDamme @PALNWS @FranckenTheo Ben beniewd where the social resistance lies. Housing shortage, energy poverty, lack of care capacity unsustainable government debts to keep things going? 14.2% producer inflation. Somewhere the incompetence valve is empty.
@bartdecl I am pro vaccination, but also at 100% vaccination will not be controlled by COVID-19. It will not be mandatory, but it will have the desired effect, but it will generate a lot of resistance. What does? To promote permanent hygiene measures, avoid masses and stay at home with symptoms.
@marcellagerwerf I am not against mouth caps in periods when there are many viruses going around. Have already done quite a lot of research for that when corona broke out in China. Only then FFP2. Protecting yourself. Of course building resistance is also useful... but well, that comes through the kids;-)
Maybe Urkse dna n offers very good resistance. God will know. His inbred village
@hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! That's the risk you're running, huh?
@marcje74 @ghostybuster79 @NOS You think it's normal that people who are NUL at risk from a virus get heart problems because of a vaccine they don't need and aren't helping others? Are you sure this account isn't also a Hugo-paid troll account, like the other one?

@WLMD @Gazendam_Petra @EenToday @marcdullaert Oriana really doesn't want to go to school before she's vaccinated. She doesn't want to get sick herself, even if the risk to me wouldn't be that big anymore.

@PieterOmtzigt RIVM and OMT represent only a (specifically, and strongly influenced by pharma) part of "the science'. By @hugodejonge and @jpaternotte @RolandPierik this is put into a rhetorical trick as the only science you should believe in, and the rest is wappie.
@belle_derks @GabyLunansky @GijsvanSust I've been through the tail of the old days, where senior professors were assigned standard AiOs. Bad for the AiOs, bad for the young driven UDs and UHDs, and bad for science. So that never happens again.

@switchinblades @Marcel4X @greenlinks No one is obliged to be nice, not that there is something wrong with that, but this goes much further. This is a radical thought well and it asks an entire society to conform to what they think. She completely ignores science.

Would Mark Rutte with that high tone of his against Warsaw ever think for one second of the 630 Polish soldiers who died in the liberation of NL in 1944 - 1944 - 1945? Surely not. Because with that science you would think: something more careful can also be. #rutte #polen

Something bad, such as socialism and communism, which has also failed and collapsed, can never produce anything good. Nor can it ever succeed, or build anything. This seems to be something left-wing neo-stalinists such as EU (SSR) Commissioner Timmermans do not realize.

@Bartes73193791 I also realized that the Nazis simply never left. The great wars were only links in a much larger spectacle.
@hans68lm Good afternoon sweetheart, thank you, I always find this a spectacle again, especially when the sun is there with a bunch of pile clouds that are driven by the wind and so brings the colors off and on into the spotlights. For you a nice Wednesday too.
When the field lioneriks (who weren't called that at the time) saw this spectacle, they had had enough and with united forces these birds raised a skewer and they peed Ritchie Leeuwenhart in the midst of Flanders Fields.

@taal_en_tekst @huus2020 Everyone should know that a vaccination is for when you are infected. Then your immune system only works to stop the infection. Then you almost always get less or not sick and the virus is faster out of your body. So less chance to infect others.

@DeStralendeSter Nice and short and powerful. I've heard it 10 times. It must be firmly anchored in the memory. It's all a sad thing but the evidence surrounding the theory of a conspiracy is getting pretty tight right now. Thank you.

@VerbrugghenGert Theory about Cleese's education?
@Manga187 I think it's more of a way to make non-Muslims think than it is for Muslims themselves as evidence. In discussions non-Muslims easily assume that Muslims like Christians believe that the Big Bag theory is incompatible with Islam.
@LeoenLea2 @Leodeadvisor @RMBras1973 It's not so much a conspiracy theory you make of it but a simple observation of facts. Look at the big cities where the native Dutch are already in the minority. Add to that that immigrants have more children plus via mass migration.

Today some legitimize the Qor'an himself. Both 'legitimation strategies' are misplaced. The Qor'an is among other things a book of drawings, not a book of science. And linking to scientific theory and speculation is potentially very misplaced and dangerous.
Some Muslims cite the 'Big Bang Theory' that might stand in the Qor'an as'strong proof' of the existence of a Higher Power.

@ThomasVanwing That depends on whether you would invent it now, or at the time. In both cases probably the same as at the time, because at that time we had not invented the knowledge we now have... let alone the prosperity.

@LifeboatRoli @margabult Don't worry about that kind of unacceptable risk takers. Drivers also exclude from care. Smokers definitely don't give any more help. People with obesity send them to the Mac. Footballers with broken legs. Yes just let their own football carers splint it and hope for the best...
@mistwitcha @harryhol @PolitieLE But it's true that several people say it and I haven't heard you deny it yet. And that you've worked in the police department only shows how corrupt the system is. And the MSM doesn't say anything about it again! Then you know it's true!
@Harrienack @telegraaf It goes from evil to worse in our beautiful Netherlands. Rutte but cycling in Amsterdam, of the prince no evil conscious. Meanwhile, the Dutch are murdered, by bullets, knives, violence or indeed under the tram pushed by 3 tinted perpetrators..
@gherusselman Trust is gone...
VVD policy, 34 seats, many Dutch agree with this policy..... yet? https://t.co/g4b9PMPSFd
@RechtsprokenNL @rbankamsterdam Why are these perpetrators not mentioned by their origins. I always find it an insult to the Dutch/Polish population of their country of residence. I myself live in Germany, but I am not a German but a Dutch.
@KhuneSilvretta @OBraeckenssieck Jammer, Jetten does 10x better than Kaag.
@RonVergouwen @HumbertoTan @Aidsfonds Figures from the AIDS Fund? Does the AIDS Fund go all over Africa or only black men in the weste? https://t.co/xHFLSC9NZY
@Wim04789402 @raiseparadise @liekcornelissen That's calculated again. A benefit is designed for the first need for life, kind of poor help so it has begun. No damage when you really need it not out of calculation. It's money from all of us, that other people have to work hard for.
@Maleo56832903 @ArnoWellens The speaker who says he is from the ICU speaks about damage to the AUTO immune system.That can never be an IC nurse...This testimony is deceit...
@MARLYNE01 @AnneliesdeZeeuw By researching from many sources what these mRNA vaccines do to you. Without listening to the supporters or the opponents, you can't make a choice of sincerity. Therefore, before researching something, you also have to do self-research to gain knowledge.
@MARLYNE01 @AnneliesdeZeeuw The problem is that I am sure that these mRNA vaccines completely undermine someone's health in the long term. I prefer to be immune with my own resistance system. And I find my health the most important because without that everything else is pointless...
@MaenenL @Addo85 @AnneliesdeSeeuw Until those unvaccinated have all had the virus... then they have even more resistance...
@PucktHart Still too much work. English I can listen with half an ear and half an ear and then I usually get 80%. In French I really have to read subtitles.
@Mie9279 See here a hunting white blood cell at work to catch intruders uh, nice eh, your immune system hasn't survived a big bang uh, https://t.co/UdgdZv38re
For those who are in the final sprint for Christmas in their work, this training can just make the difference between getting completely exhausted Christmas or getting fit at the 2021 finish line. So go from deadline to sustainable and invest in your Inner Fundamentals. https://t.co/94c1PuwFBP
@valkenburg_an @noiselast Yes it is different. Last week after the work of my wife, who had also been home to eat at the Italian. Not quite full but nice and busy.
@adegraat But what is responsible for the current measures? What measures, everything is released. As a care worker I can still go to work if a roommate has been tested poetically, I really don't need to use a pbm from the RIVM while I work with vulnerable people...1
Full bowl at the evening about "How do I improve my work?" with the amazing "Ottoman" district "Ottoman" as moderator and sidekick "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman."
@RoyGrinwis Think of yourself Roy, I don't know the motivation of this fellow fellow maybe it's not a colleague, maybe a colleague with a trauma, maybe something else and maybe such a keyboard hero who is so stupid that it still stumbles over wireless internet.
I sent an e-mail today to the board of directors of my work in which I expressed my concerns about caring for people with autism and an Ivb. I received an empathic e-mail with a plan of approach the same day. Wow so it can also work #indezorg
@zukubestevaer Good preparation is half the work! #FirstDates
Wow: save the world and win beautiful film prizes: congratulations 'Captain Nova', with the @Cinekid Leeuwen voor Beste Nederlandse Kinderfilm 2021 &amp; Beste Kinderfilm 2021! Nice work Maurice Trouwborst, Keplerfilm, cast en crew! Read also: https://t.co/LkDSmHIssh https://t.co/mvOF6YRycn
@Jandevries2005 @JaapJansen In addition, I wonder how many sides it should be emphasized that our 150 MPs (now also compared to various foreign countries) are getting their sign so full, that you have to worry if they can do their job properly. (spoiler: mwa)
@GoddessTess8 Eat tasty goddess. Nice to see you enjoying while I'm working for you.
@marnixbe Thinking that there is a lot of ONLINE civil service at work... that you can still see from the often unnecessary traffic signs!!
@Mariskaatje1985 Today at work with lunch we talked about this too. So dirty. Between your yellow custard still pieces of potato oatmeal
@PatriciaFoort @delinkserat Jaaaa delicious to say that to her! Do all baristas write that please on her cup??? #barista #nanninga #neegaweg
@Rob_DeLaMadera especially no maths and writing teaching the kids
This is really super based. Rappers who call for degeneration; promote fornication, drugs and gangster life zehma? Is good brother, go write lyrics in your solitary cell LMAO https://t.co/WzW63VuqK9
Carlos Vinícius scored 6 times last season for Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League. At PSV he didn't convince in his raids yet, but it seems a little early to write him off. A great opportunity for him tonight at the Philips Stadium.
@WoutDevoght @PeterBuysrogge I always want to write a sincere recommendation letter but doubt if this is a good marketing move.
@Writing Tigress Should start writing a book...........................................................................................................
@MarcelHaenen A default write. Can be pulled out with few simple adjustments for each demonstration.
@HartvNL Jaa die Vve и We can also write an Omnibus about that
@RTLnews Rutte thinks? Rutte lies you wanted to write? Mark puts on too big pants, hand in his own bosom he would. Other EU countries laugh at him secretly, and rightly so.
@annexum_huib @BinckBank @saxobank Once with your observations. I find the greatest drama to be the retention of margin when writing covered. Who makes this up?
@h_wonderful mama I read,just writing someone beautiful picture I can confirm beautiful photo.
@Immetjes @TheYazzThing @SanKa112 also you can say something about that. What makes people less if they make language mistakes or could not write 100 % correctly, or not eat completely neatly at the table? Again: I'm more concerned with people's actions, and not if they can talk neatly or without mistakes..
@LithNoortje Go on with that!! Not only do they not know, but they also think they have more right. Easily write off other people!
@Kakhiel Exactly. Otherwise they wouldn't write it that way.
Why is the broadcast time of @hetklokhuis getting shorter and shorter while the bullshit around it is getting longer and army, @buitnntr!? Great potato fries info got with among others @BramLadage #Ladage #youth #tv https://t.co/NswaOUI4Wi
Kökcü's free kicks in the youth under 21 were 100x better. #Feyenoord
@Mirjam152 Bad youth and his studies provide for gentleness...task!
There is no hope for the youth anymore! I put on hallelujah of cohen and this child asks if I can put on the real version????
Transition from field to room for youth! - The field season is almost over, with the B1 and the two C teams becoming champions! Furthermore another special season, where we certainly have (with the necessary flexibility) competitions... - https://t.co/drJpnaPPWQ
Young people in NL are increasingly experiencing unhealthy #stress and performance pressure. The regional knowledge workshop youth and family centre has 6 recommendations to reduce this pressure. #NetworkBetterTogether #home chairs #appropriate education #learning law #Utrecht https://t.co/4yvk9QBUCd
@EelcoHoecke Once Eelco, so done with that crybear from the CDA, that Afghan vacationer from the @cda who wants even longer waiting lists for homes for our youth.

@artbysophia Whoever was at the base was later convicted twice for child abuse. That's how uncomfortable is the youth industry. Read a recommendation on LinkedIn vd team leader on how good she is at getting the money.
@voetveeg_yuri I get upset when I realize that this band has more supporters among the 40+s than among the youth;)
@VanderVegt1973 @SteenksRafaela Me too. In my youth several times a year stay Kieldrecht and Merksem. At family. Super fun time and a delicious language. Beer at the luncheon instead of water. And filled chocolate bar afterwards.
@wierdduk The Dutch youth, are the new English!
@sonnyspek No, I had a happy childhood. Elementary school was more fun. High school was less fun, but still more fun than my student days. The time after my studies is also more fun. Actually, my student days were the worst time of my life.
@Mirjam152 What is he thinking? Where did this crazy childhood come from? Haven't they ever been raised?
