@bol_com Years ago I ordered what was canceled with you, while you can really only offer what you can deliver. Two months ago I won resistance: ordered something again. Not delivered. After two inquiries it would be sent again. I'm still waiting. Bad guys!
@NOS The virus gets the chance to mutate in vaccinated people, stop that vaccination and let us resist the work
@fatihbaey Types of and was clear at the time. The coronavirus is new and several variants of it have been added; now there is a doubt about a new variant again. My point is that certainty on resistance to corona is more limited with a new vaccine..2)
@nienewoud @dancalegria Same goes for Aspergillosis, this fungus occurs almost everywhere and is harmless to healthy people but can be dangerous to people with reduced resistance. Don't know where he thinks his mouth is but Amoeben lives in the colon.
@Alyfeenstrapau1 @telegraaf Don't give once had natural resistance can't prick against it In addition, vaccinees don't have to be afraid..protected against corona
@dvhn_nl The wonderphrase: "If that helps to contain Covid" It doesn't help, that's the whole point!! If we have to mass up to the Pampers I would do that if it helped. BUT IT DOES NOT HELP!! Stronger, bad for your resistance...
@Sabje1979 @faith Just make sure that children build up resistance and eat healthier food instead of leaking them. I can't believe the fear of some people, how is that possible?!
@EelcoHoecke is also unnecessary, only in case of severely reduced resistance. But there is more going on. Every news broadcast you hear more beat-up stories about increasing infections. That beat up my new variant, is meant to persuade vaccine refusers. More than 82% has already been vaccinated!
@yuroon @Houdy87309831 @BataafseNazorg New group I would do: Bataafse Bible study. Daily exegesis of Prophet Kat's Word. I thought by the way that Bataven heroically resisted the casting of the Low Countries. A little crisis of conscience?
Give me that natural resistance posted on /r/Forum_Democracy #FvD #ForumFor Democracy #Reddit https://t.co/YXW3A72QFo
@TruthRaider1 @Irisblossoms But there is very little resistance in the real world. On Twitter you would believe (and hope) that it is different, but look around you! Fear is the ultimate influence agent. The goedemunicipality is like wax in their hands. And I don't have a good word left for it.
@AlwinDamme @PALNWS @FranckenTheo Ben beniewd where the social resistance lies. Housing shortage, energy poverty, lack of care capacity unsustainable government debts to keep things going? 14.2% producer inflation. Somewhere the incompetence valve is empty.
@bartdecl I am pro vaccination, but also at 100% vaccination will not be controlled by COVID-19. It will not be mandatory, but it will have the desired effect, but it will generate a lot of resistance. What does? To promote permanent hygiene measures, avoid masses and stay at home with symptoms.
@marcellagerwerf I am not against mouth caps in periods when there are many viruses going around. Have already done quite a lot of research for that when corona broke out in China. Only then FFP2. Protecting yourself. Of course building resistance is also useful... but well, that comes through the kids;-)
Maybe Urkse dna n offers very good resistance. God will know. His inbred village
@hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! That's the risk you're running, huh?
@marcje74 @ghostybuster79 @NOS You think it's normal that people who are NUL at risk from a virus get heart problems because of a vaccine they don't need and aren't helping others? Are you sure this account isn't also a Hugo-paid troll account, like the other one?

@vanLeeuwenRuud 1. A person who is vaccinated takes a conscious risk of side effects. 2. Obesity, paralysis symptoms due to nitrous oxide, coma drinking. Head or tail?
@nigroeveld @silentanger5 @thierrybaudet Also read "New Digital Age." It's more complicated than there is a small club that directs everything. We're all there to promote positive developments and avoid risks. That's a big challenge. Conspiracy theory is not helpful.
@WLMD @Gazendam_Petra @EenToday @marcdullaert Oriana really doesn't want to go to school before she's vaccinated. She doesn't want to get sick herself, even if the risk to me wouldn't be that big anymore.

@PieterOmtzigt RIVM and OMT represent only a (specifically, and strongly influenced by pharma) part of "the science'. By @hugodejonge and @jpaternotte @RolandPierik this is put into a rhetorical trick as the only science you should believe in, and the rest is wappie.
@belle_derks @GabyLunansky @GijsvanSust I've been through the tail of the old days, where senior professors were assigned standard AiOs. Bad for the AiOs, bad for the young driven UDs and UHDs, and bad for science. So that never happens again.
@WaterrinkerP And then there's another mediator who helps you sell your home to foreign interested parties. In the higher segment. They're called Qualis, also a nice science for @sylviawhiteman
@switchinblades @Marcel4X @greenlinks No one is obliged to be nice, not that there is something wrong with that, but this goes much further. This is a radical thought well and it asks an entire society to conform to what they think. She completely ignores science.
There are always know-how. As long as they only endanger themselves, you can have patience but not if they endanger older people and patients. Employers, that is their duty to care, must apply the knowledge about dangers; according to the state of science. https://t.co/4LuaKF7qPl

@IreneHoogenraad @ljmzwan @BenserWalt @OBraeckenssieck I fully agree with that, but I also trust the science, mistakes are made there, but the figures also show that the vaccines are working, they clearly bring down the deadly side of the story m
@mzelst @NickiVerweij @jasper_nld That's easy to say with today's science.
Would Mark Rutte with that high tone of his against Warsaw ever think for one second of the 630 Polish soldiers who died in the liberation of NL in 1944 - 1944 - 1945? Surely not. Because with that science you would think: something more careful can also be. #rutte #polen

@trias_politica @plottereye And in that speech I only recognized things that everyone would say with common sense. EU is not a state, just a partnership between sovereign states and that the EU would do wisely to show a little more humility, which they do not like to hear in Brussels.

@IkJust79 That's part of the explanation given to me by my doctor to encourage you not to take the vaccine for the time being. There's also good information about it and the reason why the package leaflets still state that you shouldn't take the vaccine in case of allergy.

@DeStralendeSter Nice and short and powerful. I've heard it 10 times. It must be firmly anchored in the memory. It's all a sad thing but the evidence surrounding the theory of a conspiracy is getting pretty tight right now. Thank you.

@VerbrugghenGert Theory about Cleese's education?
@Manga187 I think it's more of a way to make non-Muslims think than it is for Muslims themselves as evidence. In discussions non-Muslims easily assume that Muslims like Christians believe that the Big Bag theory is incompatible with Islam.
@LeoenLea2 @Leodeadvisor @RMBras1973 It's not so much a conspiracy theory you make of it but a simple observation of facts. Look at the big cities where the native Dutch are already in the minority. Add to that that immigrants have more children plus via mass migration.

Today some legitimize the Qor'an himself. Both 'legitimation strategies' are misplaced. The Qor'an is among other things a book of drawings, not a book of science. And linking to scientific theory and speculation is potentially very misplaced and dangerous.
Some Muslims cite the 'Big Bang Theory' that might stand in the Qor'an as'strong proof' of the existence of a Higher Power.

@greenlinks Green Left also understands that if all this is going to be pushed through immediately, the prosperity that we now have will no longer be like this? Tell that to the honest. Tell that to the kindergarten children as well.
@TjerkLangman @VoltNederland #EU becomes more powerful by acting against members who do not take it so closely with principles of the rule of law. And non-members who want to eat from multiple economic ramparts are discouraged. Complicated but necessary mhoo peace, security, prosperity and well-being of Europeans.
@VincentVQ I think there are many real liberals watching you destroy our prosperity in such a short time. Making extremist left-wing idiots do this is as bad as doing it themselves.
When I lived in #Budel in the 1970s, that village derived much of its prosperity from the German barracks. The barracks are gone and in the buildings there is now an azc. I hear from EenVandaag that the inhabitants are less happy with it.
@KJ53384990 @SchipholWatch @tiesjoost Keep Schiphol as a hub because that's good for our accessibility and prosperity. Schiphol has been a hub for over 50 years so all neighbors could know that they were going to live next to a large international air node.
@nexitdenktank They see the build-up of debt. EU cooperation leads to lower prosperity, higher debt and lower disposable income. A union that has led itself to believe that it can only exist by creating more debt instead of adding value is doomed.
@umarebru @Kristine29ha There is conscious undercapacity for three reasons: 1. Maintain vaccination command; 2. Polarization in society, divide and rule; 3. Measures such as lock-down are always motivating. And so there is acting. At the expense of well-being, prosperity, freedom and human lives.
@mariannezw We did know, but we didn't want to know it might be appropriate. Everything for prosperity and freedom. Because according to HdJ freedom is not without borders.
Vaccinates who facilitate Nazi government help to destroy their own economy and prosperity. SUKKELS! Tasty NWO playing into the map by breaking down the economy. #TheGreatReset verse https://t.co/kCleI70eGr
@ThomasVanwing That depends on whether you would invent it now, or at the time. In both cases probably the same as at the time, because at that time we had not invented the knowledge we now have... let alone the prosperity.

@LifeboatRoli @margabult Don't worry about that kind of unacceptable risk takers. Drivers also exclude from care. Smokers definitely don't give any more help. People with obesity send them to the Mac. Footballers with broken legs. Yes just let their own football carers splint it and hope for the best...
@mistwitcha @harryhol @PolitieLE But it's true that several people say it and I haven't heard you deny it yet. And that you've worked in the police department only shows how corrupt the system is. And the MSM doesn't say anything about it again! Then you know it's true!
@Harrienack @telegraaf It goes from evil to worse in our beautiful Netherlands. Rutte but cycling in Amsterdam, of the prince no evil conscious. Meanwhile, the Dutch are murdered, by bullets, knives, violence or indeed under the tram pushed by 3 tinted perpetrators..
@gherusselman Trust is gone...
VVD policy, 34 seats, many Dutch agree with this policy..... yet? https://t.co/g4b9PMPSFd
@RechtsprokenNL @rbankamsterdam Why are these perpetrators not mentioned by their origins. I always find it an insult to the Dutch/Polish population of their country of residence. I myself live in Germany, but I am not a German but a Dutch.
@KhuneSilvretta @OBraeckenssieck Jammer, Jetten does 10x better than Kaag.
@RonVergouwen @HumbertoTan @Aidsfonds Figures from the AIDS Fund? Does the AIDS Fund go all over Africa or only black men in the weste? https://t.co/xHFLSC9NZY
@Wim04789402 @raiseparadise @liekcornelissen That's calculated again. A benefit is designed for the first need for life, kind of poor help so it has begun. No damage when you really need it not out of calculation. It's money from all of us, that other people have to work hard for.
@Maleo56832903 @ArnoWellens The speaker who says he is from the ICU speaks about damage to the AUTO immune system.That can never be an IC nurse...This testimony is deceit...
@MARLYNE01 @AnneliesdeZeeuw By researching from many sources what these mRNA vaccines do to you. Without listening to the supporters or the opponents, you can't make a choice of sincerity. Therefore, before researching something, you also have to do self-research to gain knowledge.
@MARLYNE01 @AnneliesdeZeeuw The problem is that I am sure that these mRNA vaccines completely undermine someone's health in the long term. I prefer to be immune with my own resistance system. And I find my health the most important because without that everything else is pointless...
@MaenenL @Addo85 @AnneliesdeSeeuw Until those unvaccinated have all had the virus... then they have even more resistance...
@PucktHart Still too much work. English I can listen with half an ear and half an ear and then I usually get 80%. In French I really have to read subtitles.
@Mie9279 See here a hunting white blood cell at work to catch intruders uh, nice eh, your immune system hasn't survived a big bang uh, https://t.co/UdgdZv38re
For those who are in the final sprint for Christmas in their work, this training can just make the difference between getting completely exhausted Christmas or getting fit at the 2021 finish line. So go from deadline to sustainable and invest in your Inner Fundamentals. https://t.co/94c1PuwFBP
@valkenburg_an @noiselast Yes it is different. Last week after the work of my wife, who had also been home to eat at the Italian. Not quite full but nice and busy.
@adegraat But what is responsible for the current measures? What measures, everything is released. As a care worker I can still go to work if a roommate has been tested poetically, I really don't need to use a pbm from the RIVM while I work with vulnerable people...1
Full bowl at the evening about "How do I improve my work?" with the amazing "Ottoman" district "Ottoman" as moderator and sidekick "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman" at the "Ottoman."
@RoyGrinwis Think of yourself Roy, I don't know the motivation of this fellow fellow maybe it's not a colleague, maybe a colleague with a trauma, maybe something else and maybe such a keyboard hero who is so stupid that it still stumbles over wireless internet.
I sent an e-mail today to the board of directors of my work in which I expressed my concerns about caring for people with autism and an Ivb. I received an empathic e-mail with a plan of approach the same day. Wow so it can also work #indezorg
@zukubestevaer Good preparation is half the work! #FirstDates
Wow: save the world and win beautiful film prizes: congratulations 'Captain Nova', with the @Cinekid Leeuwen voor Beste Nederlandse Kinderfilm 2021 &amp; Beste Kinderfilm 2021! Nice work Maurice Trouwborst, Keplerfilm, cast en crew! Read also: https://t.co/LkDSmHIssh https://t.co/mvOF6YRycn
@Jandevries2005 @JaapJansen In addition, I wonder how many sides it should be emphasized that our 150 MPs (now also compared to various foreign countries) are getting their sign so full, that you have to worry if they can do their job properly. (spoiler: mwa)
@GoddessTess8 Eat tasty goddess. Nice to see you enjoying while I'm working for you.
@marnixbe Thinking that there is a lot of ONLINE civil service at work... that you can still see from the often unnecessary traffic signs!!
@Mariskaatje1985 Today at work with lunch we talked about this too. So dirty. Between your yellow custard still pieces of potato oatmeal
@PatriciaFoort @delinkserat Jaaaa delicious to say that to her! Do all baristas write that please on her cup??? #barista #nanninga #neegaweg
@Rob_DeLaMadera especially no maths and writing teaching the kids
This is really super based. Rappers who call for degeneration; promote fornication, drugs and gangster life zehma? Is good brother, go write lyrics in your solitary cell LMAO https://t.co/WzW63VuqK9
Carlos Vinícius scored 6 times last season for Tottenham Hotspur in the Europa League. At PSV he didn't convince in his raids yet, but it seems a little early to write him off. A great opportunity for him tonight at the Philips Stadium.
@WoutDevoght @PeterBuysrogge I always want to write a sincere recommendation letter but doubt if this is a good marketing move.
@Writing Tigress Should start writing a book...........................................................................................................
@MarcelHaenen A default write. Can be pulled out with few simple adjustments for each demonstration.
@HartvNL Jaa die Vve и We can also write an Omnibus about that
@RTLnews Rutte thinks? Rutte lies you wanted to write? Mark puts on too big pants, hand in his own bosom he would. Other EU countries laugh at him secretly, and rightly so.
@annexum_huib @BinckBank @saxobank Once with your observations. I find the greatest drama to be the retention of margin when writing covered. Who makes this up?
@h_wonderful mama I read,just writing someone beautiful picture I can confirm beautiful photo.
@Immetjes @TheYazzThing @SanKa112 also you can say something about that. What makes people less if they make language mistakes or could not write 100 % correctly, or not eat completely neatly at the table? Again: I'm more concerned with people's actions, and not if they can talk neatly or without mistakes..
@LithNoortje Go on with that!! Not only do they not know, but they also think they have more right. Easily write off other people!
@Kakhiel Exactly. Otherwise they wouldn't write it that way.
Why is the broadcast time of @hetklokhuis getting shorter and shorter while the bullshit around it is getting longer and army, @buitnntr!? Great potato fries info got with among others @BramLadage #Ladage #youth #tv https://t.co/NswaOUI4Wi
Kökcü's free kicks in the youth under 21 were 100x better. #Feyenoord
@Mirjam152 Bad youth and his studies provide for gentleness...task!
There is no hope for the youth anymore! I put on hallelujah of cohen and this child asks if I can put on the real version????
Transition from field to room for youth! - The field season is almost over, with the B1 and the two C teams becoming champions! Furthermore another special season, where we certainly have (with the necessary flexibility) competitions... - https://t.co/drJpnaPPWQ
Young people in NL are increasingly experiencing unhealthy #stress and performance pressure.

@EelcoHoecke Once Eelco, so done with that crybear from the CDA, that Afghan vacationer from the @cda who wants even longer waiting lists for homes for our youth.

@artbysophia Whoever was at the base was later convicted twice for child abuse. That's how uncomfortable is the youth industry. Read a recommendation on LinkedIn vd team leader on how good she is at getting the money.
@voetveeg_yuri I get upset when I realize that this band has more supporters among the 40+s than among the youth;)
@VanderVegt1973 @SteenksRafaela Me too. In my youth several times a year stay Kieldrecht and Merksem. At family. Super fun time and a delicious language. Beer at the luncheon instead of water. And filled chocolate bar afterwards.
@wierdduk The Dutch youth, are the new English!
@sonnyspek No, I had a happy childhood. Elementary school was more fun. High school was less fun, but still more fun than my student days. The time after my studies is also more fun. Actually, my student days were the worst time of my life.
@Mirjam152 What is he thinking? Where did this crazy childhood come from? Haven't they ever been raised?
