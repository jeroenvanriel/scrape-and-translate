@geeskegrietje @DerkBoswijk @cdavandaag @carolaschouten 2) Nature is largely progressing. Habitat guidelines are misinterpreted. Nitrogen is heavily understandarded. Groundwater is of good quality in agricultural areas. Cows are counted 3 times too harmfully vwb climate. And so I can continue for a while.

@stellastarlight I do not suspect anyone who closes with 'ACAB' of any objectivity.
@other_thinking That obsession with objectivity is pure selfishness. To measure the value of God to yourself instead of the other way around.
@ChrisvdKieboom Uncle Agent completely upset, but in the actual violent demonstrations of the peasants nobody gets in the way. The police have even lost the appearance of objectivity in the meantime.
@ADnl AD is also starting to become more and more laughable and unbelievable. Zero professionalism and objectivity. Bouquet series has more content
Why are some believers so obsessed with objectivity? If God exists He is the ultimate reality, but God is surely not a thing/object? God is a spirit/subject!
@IntoBits @parandanah Well, people like her, Rena Netjes and Ans Boersma often have a crush as motivation. Frederique for example had a relationship with a PKK captain, neatly also something like that plus condemned for helping terrorism and Boersma we remember. Objectivity from the window.
@TjerkLangman Governments in general, no example when it comes to reliability and objectivity
@rvdb51 In fact again a very good left groaning pen fruit of yours, dear Raymond vd Boogaard. The lack of objectivity, integrity and truth again shows a classic aversion against anything that smells slightly to the right. Standard standard at DGA.
@NickdenHolland3 @nata5jaa @thierrybaudet @marcelbar8 Phoe, I didn't see that objectivity coming Nick. A lot of work on the PvdA store bowing for you, I understand - put it on.
@jdceulaer Objectivity is far away again. Money burned from here to Tokyo but no, he's the sober one. It should be someone from the N-VA. That man would be taken care of until the end of time for what he did. But this is FVDB and "that's different."
@noorlanderarjan There goes your objectivity. Through the word "understandable..."
@jdceulaer @PVerijke @BenWeyts Your objectivity is hard to find. I experience that you are on a crusade earlier to get you right. You are one of those reasons why I no longer buy newspapers.
@JaronBlonk Jaron, you also mentioned/named of the Beek absolute world top. Think that your objectivity when it comes to (ex) Ajax players is as high as that of Neal with the Dutch Junior players who once entered the show. Small tip; Not present.

@keesjan @volkskrant Oh yes here you have glass ceilings and 'white men' but to Afghanistan 'don't look with western eyes' of course. No orientalism but racism of low expectations.

@Walrathis The total number from home placements is 40,000, there is much more in self-reliance and participation that is not right. The protest parties are not a solution there are politicians who do do the word people but have nothing else to do with it.

@Assita_Kanko I don't think it's a good idea to base our policy on the opinion of women in Afghanistan. Ask the Belgian women. There's plenty of veiled women in there.
@pretfles @ABynens @MichaelDeBoey93 Can't imagine that you can justify the policy and this system or even exalt. Belgium is really a failed state... and those who deny it or don't see it have insufficient information, I'm afraid.
Open Vld and CD &amp; V are questioning the credibility of the vaccines. Politically questionable, unworthy policy on tv
@Benavra No, in Rutte's hardline BV Nederland policy the words'management', 'consultant','marketing' and 'toolbox' are very common. Ask his advisor Ben Verwaayen.
It's time for a fair policy for everyone.
@sumixamxefitnop That a zero covid policy doesn't work, that the measures don't work (never worked), that the vaccines don't work... that we've been lied to by politicians and virologists for almost 2 years! That this isn't about health but about CONTROL!

@DavevanOoijen Come out of that tunnel and stop being a fan of that modern craze of political correctness. We come out your throat, people like you come out our throats. It doesn't change. Let that get to you.
Political correctness is deadly, just look: "guardian didn't stop terrorist 'from being called racist'' (https://t.co/aCjF6cSwH9), and this "fear of racism hinders research into sex gangs' (https://t.co/GNFvjz2Jtb)https://t.co/K4O31qvpk5
@EditionNL Another lesson learned as a sushi enthusiast on the other hand surprises me that western touch not. Look at the Chinese-Indian (take-away) restaurants when they became popular. The dishes are tailored to the taste of Western culture.
@grain salt84 Really that yes. Too fake and crazy too popular behavior. And that stupid phone call all the time, ridiculous.
@LuuktenKleij He is especially popular there in Turkey and has had several number 1 hits there. Is more successful there than in the Netherlands.
@WIS_JanvA Smoked egg yolk is currently popular in the better restaurant.
Not only in our frog country is Verpakking popular.▁rechts https://t.co/9ZxyuoqTnY #F1 #Restep
@FemkeNijboer @SpijkerAnita @TheoHakkert @Tubantia Da's Cruijffian reporting. Since the corona crisis very popular. But you don't get it until you understand...
@DavidEerdmans Rutte shows followership. That's different from leadership, but you'll be popular with it in the Netherlands.
@Lydia54930030 @WouterDeVriendt @kristofcalvo @AnneliesVl @Sophie_Wilmes I think they can be very wrong about that. Flemish Interest is very popular with youth
A bestseller about an emancipated woman and four special book tips by Marita Mathijsen from the 19th century. Then very popular, now still worth reading! Go to our website for all tips from @MaritaMathijsen: https://t.co/IC13reNJuc. https://t.co/w57DH0X1hd
@PaintingFleurs This has been around for quite a long time but he always does series and then often riverdale, you, match etc just what is always popular
@JoostNiemoller Yes at the @christenunie in the backrooms. To make @gertjanseegers popular again. so that he, so again, gets more sympathy from his supporters. To help their #GreatReset as the so-called goodgay, the new Tunisian criminal cabinet, 4 years later.
Yes no Rinske is very popular in Sneek I don't understand why she's not mayor weird, do I?
@brittsnl Beautiful flowers! My father also had them in his garden. In the Netherlands years out of fashion, but now again popular.
@sheilasitalsing @ZahraBoef Sheila Sittalsing before it was popular to feel sorry for those who have suffered from the surcharge affair https://t.co/3c79xjGiSF

@BizzCreators @https_amber @hrjcsj In addition, it is quite strange to have sex in a toilet with a stranger. That is a male fantasma from pornography, never reality. Things like condoms, stopwords, etc. must first be agreed and respected: otherwise it is also legal rape
@vagant7383 @Bartes73193791 Idd, pornography is n private business tss 2 or more people subject to mutual consent, a certainly not tss a perverse employer stalking his workers with horny pornographic text messages etc. Would you like to hear if your daughter's married boss would so harass her...
@SweetOrchid @Bartes73193791 Van de Veire,Dhondt,Van Samang,Van Gucht.Drugs are shit.Pornography remains a private matter between two persons.

@JurianvanderRee @MathijsvdTang What facts @JurianvanderRee? Which suffers less than 3 percent from gender dysphoria? Maybe a time to ban pornography and 'transitions' and restore male/female role patterns? And help these people (through therapy for example).
@baspaternotte Blaming Pornography? As if people can't get to the real stuff via a tinderdate.
@VALENTiNE_1_ @Vrijkers1 Where do you report him on...? Doesn't want to do that.. But nowhere sexually tinted or pornography to mention on Twitter
It is 2021. Museums with exhibitions are forced out to OnlyFans, after a banishment of social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and TikTok because of 'pornography'. But #woke really doesn't exist! #trutting #regression #freedom https://t.co/hicXGRwsQR
More lucrative than pornography, so an understandable development, with our very free definition of freedom, here. And the price (tighter enforcement on what really isn't allowed) that we don't seem to want to pay.
@NUnl That's way too far anyway, halllooo becomes superman cartoon now a pornography that children are going to read are all insane. Super hero has now gone a big slut and from hero to whore.
@UnpleasantTrut2 @vrtnws On the news we're talking about a radicalized man who converted to Islam. Every Islamic/Muslim is radical, one somewhat more than the other. A moderate Islam is the same as non-erotic pornography. That doesn't exist.
'Rejecting identity because racism exists is like rejecting sex because pornography exists.' (Eric Defoort) #Classic https://t.co/Kim40K0JEJ
@jensbosman2 The incel community itself knows no mercy for women who are tempted to pornography. Sid is over 30, probably didn't do this for the money and with full sense registered for this porn. He is not imho insanityable
@Patrick024 @martijnrosdorff @AndreKrouwel @klichtendonk Religion exists as real as communism exists or postcolonialism. As a scientist or journalist, the truth claim of religion is not so interesting (because, by definition, unverifiable), it is relevant what people do with it.
#we are natives I am a student of Dutch and have received several lectures about Dutch-language hip-hop, female writers in the Early Modern Time, climate literature and postcolonialism. And then say that "the new society is not anchored in the curriculum."

@polienskie There were already thinkers, imm gender and postcolonialism, which were later seen as important for postmodernism. So that way there are germs in that period. 2/2
@arongroot That postcolonialism would have been a lot further if Douwes Dekker had just made drawings.

@BlommaertWim @HChrisson @moudry (2/2) With his platform as a very influential and public intellectual, you would expect more intellectual responsibility. He systematically presents different movements such as Marxism, postcolonialism, etc. in an extremely simple way.
@ZhongQuanDa a civil war 5 years after independence and you think it has nothing to do with the exploitation and colonization that took place 5 years before explicitly? and postcolonialism is also a thing.
@tscheldt And with art 1382, we end up seamlessly in the era of postcolonialism.
@herbertkuiling I'll be a typical white man again, but didn't we first let the tropic museum/KIT (Linnaeusstraat A'dam) pass into oblivion, so many now think we never did anything about postcolonialism?https://t.co/2mKfJ0boxZ
@MERuijtenberg Ha exactly the original residents do not want a two-state solution. There is a resolution vd UN that says that the expelled Palestinians are entitled to return. The 2 states solution is postcolonialism.
"As far as I know, you can't take a course in literature science anywhere in the Low Countries without getting a course in feminist literature criticism &amp; postcolonialism." Which courses are these though? Because students at KUL aren't seeing them.
@roelsint @JaimyFox @jroode about what CRT is and what it is not (e.g.: CRT refers to a field of law that came off the ground after the civil rights movement. Then a second generation includes postmodernism. If you use the term CRT, to which do you refer?).
"It's postmodernism par excellence. The deeper you dig, the more complicated it gets and the clearer it is that this film is not meant to answer questions, but to call them up." https://t.co/nZ3wak4ADT

@jasonwalters85 I can trace it back from my lazy armchair to postmodernism, with the criticism they have of the power in the language etc. I don't feel that much for it.
@Martijn5155 "It is no longer possible to hide behind the white canvas of universalism and secularism. They are an illusion." Post-postmodernism?
@jvveen2010 I often agree with Goslinga, but find this article a portion of Black Piets to Bolkenstein. He cannot be the only cause of distrust in society. Thus, he has challenged postmodernism, but it was already doomed.
@GoudMichiel Postmodernisme has demolished the usual conversation. It's not about respect for other people's opinion. It's about finding the best truth. I only respect a well thought out and well-founded opinion. And of course always the person. The rest is wok poop.
A student V3 who asks about writing contests, a student V5 who admits that he doesn't read newspapers so often and yet summarizes an article, H4 who quietly reads with a digital fire, a student V5 who explains postmodernism for a moment. Everyone deserves #vacation.
@ReynebeauM @standard The yoke of postmodernism is finally thrown away from us: deal with it boy.
@virtualbugs You don't always have to play an open book about it, but culture Marxism/postmodernism is also something different from Marxism. At least cultural Marxism is, as the name says, the cultural part of Marxism.
@SonjaDahlmans @demo_demo_nl The whole postmodernism revolves around the absence of objective facts.
There is about that, namely the majority of the world (non-Christian). The Enlightenment took refuge in reason. We have for a hundred years (secular) philosophers who notice that objective morality does not exist (postmodernism). Why do you stay in the 19th century? https://t.co/beXutE4PzV
@NOS Everything has become more expensive from rent to house prices, groceries, Santa Claus gifts, gasoline, gas, wood, containers and go on, but our wages remain the same... This is called inflation. But if wages, benefits and pensions do not rise along we will call it poverty!
Of course, increased poverty. https://t.co/js5frXEbkG
Also significant that Annie may join instead of the researcher. Actually says everything about this talk program and many others. What a total emptiness, what a poverty. No wonder that fewer and fewer people are looking. https://t.co/gxD38IMvgL
No child should grow up in poverty https://t.co/dIg04BxvkL
@Lisawesterveld @stichtingSIRE I do not sign this petition @Lisawesterveld, because it does not go far enough. 3 cabinets Rutte have put parents into poverty. Parents who can normally take care of their children in other countries. The children are not poor, the parents have fallen into poverty by NL.
About the shocking news that thousands of families have not only been plunged into poverty by government policy and some have lost their homes, but that more than 1000 children have also been taken from parents we have not yet heard about it.
@Lisawesterveld @stichtingSIRE Next year even more families in poverty through the energy bill. Please note. Gas per m3 goes to the 2 euros. Make a calculation at Qurrent with 5000 kWh and 2000 m3 gas. Living in R'dam.
I am busy with information on menstruation. Menstruation poverty is an important topic and I am glad that a lot of action is being taken. Yet @ivandenberg in this column hits the nail on the head. #poverty #menstruation poverty #energy poverty https://t.co/9IbL4xYtpQ
Hannes: When I was still well-earned we bought biofood, did trips, went out to eat, had good care products,... That benefits the economy. Since the decline in my income due to an accident we hardly spend money, is that positive for society?
In our rich country more than 250,000 (!) children grow up in poverty. This has huge impact. Often a lifetime. Yes, the responsibility lies largely in The Hague. However, public pressure can help. Therefore, sign this petition from @stichtingSIRE &gt; https://t.co/vj05972MS3
Toes Curving #DealOrNoDeal and that bad acting presentation thing from Buddy. But poverty trumps at @RTL5 if you have to broadcast 2 hours every night! to this shit. Nomination worth #tvKnol
If you really don't want children to be taken away just like aboriginals and Indians, always vote SP or something you're quite sure of. #children of the tax service could have happened because discrimination in NL has moved to discrimination initiation of poverty.
@HenkSpaan9 Left-intellectual (if you can already say so in football) shows information poverty with these sandbox changes. Read nothing content or any debate-worthy in between. Level angry baby boomers who like to leak your football.
Enough to get rid of the rule of law. Enough to destroy lives of 10 thousands of families and children. #Extra charge scandal Enough to rob millions of elderly people of decent old age. #Retirement robbery. Many hundreds of thousands further into #poverty. Only one #Rutte https://t.co/XGGTUqXZIE
@iNtRoVeRt_Ed @green @Ecolo @vooruit_nu @PSofficial Poverty? Do you mean that half a million children have no roof over their heads and no food? I don't think you know what real poverty is. Moreover, families sometimes choose a difficult situation when they decide to bring 4 children into the world.
@Roysmid72 I would like to see Dessers to bring in his duel power, Nelson is TOP for me too!

@bolhuis_a @FiliaVeritas @gherusselman @thierrybaudet So once. Also Baudet can grow in here, because he often gives one a stick to beat with and loses his strength.

@remcodb @mathijsbouman All entrance and lack of pragmatism of @Joris_PvdA does not benefit consistency.
@PvdA is for and against CCS, who gets that. That's not so hard; @joris_pvda is in the wrong party. His visionary idealism doesn't fit well with the pragmatism of the @pvda, and he sews his own seam. https://t.co/NHA1j7UPAH #FD #Environment #Climate
@Boreout Haha, so I hadn't looked at it yet.
@peter_mertens Another proof that social dialogue in this country is dead. A consequence of the rigid attitude of the social partners, who no longer give each other a penny. Zero pragmatism, only dogmatic ideology.
Two thirds of the Netherlands are covered with green asphalt. And we let that happen. Industrial thinking, pragmatism and efficiency form a toxic mixture that has largely driven nature out. https://t.co/u5YsPQ8KAN
@sentgood @noorlanderarjan Pragmatism, realism and idealism are more necessary than opportunism. What would that circle look like?
@kimvankeken @JanDriessen @HumbertoRTL @HumbertoTan Indeed. We in Brabant had to pay particular attention to the reasonableness of the members of the States concerned. Thus the CDA stated. These do not compare with their relatives in The Hague. Lamekoek! Wrong pragmatism! Stay true to your values and norms. They are not interchangeable!
The kind of pragmatism that many anti-vax Christians could learn from.
@JDSchoolmeester Just at @CanaalZCanalZ, we've been looking at the explanation of @Zu_Demir who is just starting from pragmatism (so realism). Think that Green and CDenV aren't going to make it anymore. If you're driving in the wrong direction for an hour, you'll always have to return for an hour and you'll lose 2 hours.
@Poethiek Ah there is so much going on. Some pragmatism suits me well!
@GeertjeDekkers And @susansmitteur talks nonsense, with her 'first feminists': in a world where no 'house doctors' were found in a community, everyone with knowledge of medicine, in any way, was indispensable. Had NOTHING to do with feminism, but with pragmatism.
@shossontwits Sander, in almost all healthcare sector Dutch pragmatism has disappeared. MBO 3 for helping with support stockings is idiotic. And in corona: why not prophylaxis and early treatment with melatonin and ivermectin? Are detectable replicase inhibitors! So yes, you get a #care infarction

@OmeWillemsatire Sorry I haven't succeeded. Wouldn't be quiet if they don't pay taxes anymore. No public transport, no petrol, no shop/horeca, no pay slip, no gas, water and light. Don't they receive anymore? Rent subsidy, care allowance, child benefit, etc. https://t.co/l8vZBu5vQw
@Anarchazazel @RubenBaetens The intention of the #km tax is not necessarily extra taxes, but a steering and fairer tax shift (from tax to modulated mileage tax). This should also be allowed for public transport: during rush hours it may be more expensive (e.g. in London).
@dutchanddonts Indeed, it is a kind of tribal hypnosis created by (irrational) fear. If you do not participate in the'sacrifice', then you are a freak. The 'irony' is that rational thinking is precisely in the collective individual interest, namely, freedom and justice.

@Jan_Slagter Zuidling that someone who does not know the facts invokes facts.

@budgetary sustainability @dreoudman 't Isn't it about what I/others deserve, but about what you would have to give up because of a (other) moral dogma as soon as you wanted to rent it as a living space. That would be different if you rejected all private (own) property as immoral anyway.
Within 20 years, communion parties are taboo and Spring Festivals are freaky. The new thing becomes a gender party. Probably every 10 years. I want to be a boy between 10 and 20, I want to be a woman between 21 and 30, then I want to be a man again. Maybe we can lease names or something.

@arantxavheinde That's dirty yes... and reason to divorce.
@TunnelForce9 @AnoMientje01 @Carina_mareloca It is clear that vaccines do help. But if I understand you correctly, are you referring to, for example, the expected flu wave?

@Bjorg66914313 @TegengasTinus @missmica9 @Social Story What is the reason, if I may ask? If you have kept to the rules, there is no reason to reject it.
@WilliamTweets__ @PropertyTine I saw that you're keeping an baklava, so that's a good reason not to break up yet
@Thundertothemax @keusmark @MinVWS so you have been vaccinated against all other infectious diseases such as flu / TBC / hepatitis etc. for that reason?
@Dsoenens @VerslegersSam I often hear that signal. Head cloth ban is also important reason not to start training teacher. In Antwerp at least 100 graduates who give only Islam for that reason while they are also qualified for other subjects.
@JvdKexc @Jaikwilria Most people haven't even noticed that antivaxxers have taken all their shots from childhood except for this mRNA shot. There's a good reason for that. The whole word antivaxxers doesn't make any sense.
If this isn't a good reason to buy more real food from the farmer instead of shit from Unilever https://t.co/MZPb2SDLpf
@mirjamcigri @PieterOutrigate Obligation should not be any reason for proper ventilation. Ventilation against corona, can also work counterwired. Ventilation is moving air that can move aerosols without and with virus to another. But good ventilation is also very pleasant for other reasons.
@godmiljaarde @HildeDecleir001 You're right. Neutrality in education is still not fully realized. The Catholic net has already come a huge way in the good sense. That is an additional reason not to turn the clock back for another religion either.
@MysticMike77 @Reezyard @freekopkantoor @weathermanreinier True, but a solution if you don't want to cough up 40K at once. There are also people who rent a house and are more expensive than buyers for that reason.
@sjaak_jacq @Mercy44 @ggvanloon We are now in a devolution! There is only one possibility. 1: Overall Uprising 2: Anarchy 3: Reform 4: Revolution That's how we better bulging and resetting the place. Otherwise, getting married will be another apartheid thingy! I Have A Dream.... https://t.co/dK2qwCsNi6
@SimonsMario44 @standard What does neo-communistism mean? In practice, this was expressed in a policy that focused more on social reform than revolution and willingness to compromise with non-communist political parties. Outside Western Europe it is sometimes referred to as "neocommunistism."
@LinksFlemish Ah, but that's the flag that was used during the 1830s revolution. I thought: that's what we need back, drastic reform and revival.
@dimgrr It is part of the ambition to confer on the government a "essential' (propaganda for "totalitarian') role, so that citizens are fully governed and controlled "a self-created' condition for reform of society and introduction of the 4th Industr. Revolution.
The way Europe works with us as the biggest net payer is impossible, and without it it is not smart because China sees Russia as a danger for Europe, and with it our freedom too. Revolution and reform of the EU is needed so that we are safe together, but otherwise it will not work now!
@kvdbroec @IMFNews Reform from above to avoid revolution from below. At the IMF they realize that the stability of the system may be compromised, and then the profits will be over.
@GillardRobin @radioboiling point both reform and revolution are needed. Even though parties like the CPN have achieved little to nothing in terms of laws, they have moved people to the left, and parties like the PvdA have built the care state with prime ministers like Drees and den Uyl.
@2deRoomFVD That German blood flows where it cannot go. If there is an anarchy, revolution and reform taking place, I think it is also time for another national anthem.
@Rombrecht Banking and stock market supervision, a reform of agriculture and the use of the unemployed to work on all kinds of public buildings and projects, just as Wolff says... and funded by companies and rich people. That's not protecting but it's not revolution either.
Their death best illustrates the irreconcilability between a strategy of reform and one of revolution that they have always emphasised in their political activities. - Daniel #Bensaid on #Luxembourg &amp; #Liebknecht https://t.co/k5lP7GwJSO
Some progressive, some conservative or former progressive. In this sense, there may be a separate "liberal tradition" of divisions, including D66 and Verdonk. No Revolution or Schisma but adjustment of the pace of gradual reform/evolution. (12/14)
Gossie. The best (and with ahead richest) team of a competition has an easy afternoon. You have to look at reform of the competition, but to immediately preach the revolution every time Ajax wins fat is also so timely... https://t.co/lGTsyUQFJo
"With 2 billion in ODVs and 6 billion in excise duties, energy is already heavily taxed, so the search for a CO2 tax does not require a tax increase: A well-thought-out reform of existing energy taxes would already be a major carbon revolution." https://t.co/nYXNUCUUR
@dekkerjh @robertoostinga @MennoOng It's certainly now, everywhere agonizing and tormenting. It's certain that our commercial system of market operation doesn't work either and a lot of misery is hidden. It's time for reform, a revolution in our healthcare system.
@Rianneletschert @LimburgnaCorona Sustainable reform is fine, reforming sustainability as well, which requires a permanent revolution to avoid and/or reverse established interests and glances. So instead of everyone a vision on the way to a vision of everyone.
@telegraaf @wierdduk Zo ff listen, but I like to refer to the Orwell writings, which then describes all the hatred of one's own culture as a kind of virtuoso signalling &amp; the absolutely essential book #CynicalTheories (Helen Pluckrose/James Lindsay), in which culture relativism is described. https://t.co/wQyz4hC1lW
@AnneloesW_S Yesterday son overheard for philosophy test and came to the conclusion together that Baudet rationalism, modern metaphysics and relativism mix together and then connects wrong starting points (you can also call it populism): &gt;&gt;
@johnbijl @tonfvandijk Stop with your moral relativism. And with your Dale Carnegie.
@ellymeriwani With cynicism and relativism, everything is destroyed. In the light of the big bang it is nothing.
@ZihniOzdil @tonfvandijk A popular relativism: the occasion was there, how can I be a thief...
@Marielle_Schalk @uhasselt @j_vollenbroek MOB applies the rules strictly, id. But relativism brought us on the one hand and nowhere on the other...
@KingEdwin70 Terminal relativism because you've identified yourself too much with your ideas. It would be nice if we saw the positive effect of it, but that doesn't seem to be there.
@roelsint @kayotickitchen @jochemwesterhof The point of discussion is not that oppressive religious fundamentalism in reformatorial circles should be spared, but that it is inconsistent to do so, while much more virulent problems in Islam are spoken up under the guise of cultural relativism.
This refers to the scientism that proves a biological determinantism and the rationalism that comes with relativism and brings it all down. Source: https://t.co/U6ruCfeham
@wesleychadli @Anietje7150 That is a general consideration of course (haha). I do not assume relativism; there is an immutable core.
@govertschilling I find your 'cosmic relativism' a pleasant kind of belief in any case!
@Ammer_B @okkingaj In the Middle Ages, the "sed contra" was not an incentive to relativism.
@mariusschoenma2 @Cornelis_ @NOS On the contrary, God of the Bible blesses me that despite the secular madness and normalized perversion of the modern world I still remain faithful to Him. You obviously follow the devil as you are in favour of moral relativism and soulless hedonism.
Steengoede collum van @ZihniOzdil. Although I have not been a member of the group for several years, this moral relativism evokes recognizable frustration. https://t.co/e12TEGE5ie
@pcalu @PhRoose @Pontifex It's worse than "relativism." It's corruption.
@MegaTristan99 @Sibruh is gwn good representation of tris
What does DAFFA makers say about stereotyping, inspiration, representation and Queening the Genre? #queerhorror #queerramsterdam #queerhalloween https://t.co/HsdCXrDE5V
@wal_martijn Well, then it shouldn't be mandatory eh! At least a dangerous poll, too many people who would say no would probably have to be political grabs. Everyone knows that this is not an accurate representation of the population. All show.
Furthermore, a teacher must be hired on the basis of her/his COMPETENCES and not appearance. A teacher can take a professional role even if she wears a headscarf. The school must be a representation of current society.
High time for equal representation of women (in all their diversity) in Dutch politics! https://t.co/zCDPpuPLt0
@MichaelDeBoey93 @Steff_Peeters A combination of entertainment, representation, expenses and net compensation
@Steff_Peters 100€ representation fee.
@talithamuusse Also notice that I am very bad at people who are allowed to speak in the media on this subject and put it that way, because it suggests that you have to go hard on both sides. That is not a good representation of the much-needed social debate.
@moeva18 And another thing. You're only responsible for your own internal representation. Not for anyone else's. FKM all.
@TansiaTracy @anouktorbeyns @mohamedouamari @fanonmixtape @MrDavidJohns The documentary Disclosure may also be worth it. Is specifically about transrepresentation in Hollywood and the link with the struggle of trans persons. On Netflix available no. https://t.co/tZ2oU52j5f
My essay jumps literally from... is too little female representation in street names.... therefore women feel unsafe and men think they are powerful and women can rape.................................................................................................................................
Yes I found anne+ really an incredibly moderately milked negative sample of vague representation.
Man, what are you a lot in the picture! On November 17th we are going to talk about the new research on the representation of women in the media. Or: who do we see on the tube, what are they talking about and how can this be more equal? @De_Zwijger https://t.co/X6VT5LLkvI
@WillyWanker01 @PaulDomen It can break the stereotype that mostly men are interested in IT and AI. I think that's mainly the intention. But I get your point: it's a difficult balance sometimes between non-discrimination and diverse representation.
