@MinVWS vahide tanriverdiyeva is currently in amsterdam and will do these procedures, which are very risky in terms of health, such as aesthetics (filling, botox, facelift.) to your citizens in your country, in the house they will rent I present the instagram-

@explained @LAMBIK_ I think @geiger_jules can appreciate this aesthetic.
Sid's mental health may be sacrificed for art. Stefan says that he is tearing down Sid's content more than anyone, but it becomes clear that aesthetics are being demolished. How far can you go to demolish a fascist? https://t.co/Wau4ItGm6W
@Policy aesthetics (filling, botox, facelift.) do to your citizens in your country, in the house they will rent I present the instagram pages and identity data of this lady in the attachment. Our expectation of you
@gwenvaneijk @Melissa_Ydra Not thank you. Aesthetics is no more important than the reality in which people lie crooked from the rent.
It's not a big secret that many people in the art world find all that feminist and anti-racist criticism and art "easy', "easy', "easy', "easy', "easy' etc. Work like Kirac likes them much better, both in aesthetics and politics.
@JOVD At their best dressed. The most important thing for JOVD riders since it's all about the aesthetics of superiority. No content. Learn from my JOVD classmate who came to college every day in three-piece suit but never said a sensible word.

@RMeussen @VDL_Group This seems to be the time to inspect cavities in several places in the Netherlands and to spray with pur to prevent future use. In this way, the coming winter can be cut down. Closed with foil would be a permitted alternative.
Pay attention: usually when the (demissionary) government screws something up, Prime Minister Rutte makes it very convenient for another ruler to speak first. So the alternative looks so uncomfortable: (via @ThomasHogeling) https://t.co/6MG3Mb5yog

@Renaatjez79 Yes... After a while my Twitter starts to get very slow and run fast. The alternative is not a Twitter app. That's nothing!
@Boreout @HenkNoyen I liked using it as an alternative to What'sApp. Now it's hijacked by wappies because there's never any interference on accounts like Facebook and Twitter.

@djvanvliet Here art is placed completely above moral and ethical standards. Cruelty as a condition for higher culture. Somewhere I admire the outright consistency, but it is definitely sick, and these are people you want to stay far away from. Brrr.
@FrankBrecht The art is: don't look.
@WaterEllenM @AlertNature Environment has been called climate for a while. The scenarios are just as black. That attracts attention. Don't give them all the attention. Take notice but don't let them control your life. The art of relativizing.
@mafdrijf Shopping not only in the large shopping street, but also in the vicinity of the old molstraat. In the American Embassy (near the mauritshuis) is now a museum west. Very vague 'art' but perhaps therefore good. There is also bodega the mail horn opposite 1/

@wierdduk Do you have to split the appreciation of a football match into a judgment on the match and a judgment on the audience and then take the average?
@bobdijkgraaf Feel free to replace "feel free" with "always." Never take a break so you can bring change. Never entertain the audience and go home with "4-1" or "5-1." It makes you sad, because that's just how it's been for decades.

#KhalidenSophie is Kim Holland in the audience now?
A trailer like this reads more like an Indiana Jones reboot than a game movie, because Uncharted is Indiana Jones-as-game. Is that going to work, or is the ungaming audience missing the intermediate step this movie legitimizes at all, or does this make the games unnecessary somewhere?
Fireworks are set up in the Kuip and a large part of the audience is applauded. #feyube The level of intelligence is not very high. @ESPNNL1 @ESPNnl Weather 35,000 euros poorer.
@waterookgebeur1 Yes, and now again. That is combined with that embarrassing action last night will undoubtedly cause the idiots to ruin it for the normal audience. Anyway, we miss out on all those fines again a fine player.

@Assita_Kanko Every teacher teaches from constructive core areas, related to general knowledge, Biology, Nature, mathematics, history, languages, politics, Dutch, and religion at Christian school, Islam at Islam school etc.
For half a century, the pastor, writer and poet Hans Bouma (80) has been calling for attention to animal welfare. He derives this connection with our fellow creatures from the Bible itself, but also from biology and behavioural sciences. https://t.co/oI4LVxQX9q

@Gkessels @TeacherTappNL I always shout very loudly in class 1 that a test doesn't say anything about you. Nothing about how good you are in biology because unfortunately I can't test love for nature. Unfortunately, it counts for the students whether they switch to class 2.

@Miriam03743463 @macht_astrid @ThierryDuLac @GreekNoelle @vanLeeuwenRuud And this from someone who doesn't look beyond populism. There is no shortage of equipment or beds but staff and that is not up to level within one and a half years. Training costs at least four years and you don't get back streamers with higher workload and just as much bureaucracy.
@doamaarroze It's still to be ashamed of you... strength with the mill called bureaucracy

@JetjedeWit @Gert026 @AnneBorkent If more money was put into the staff (training, expansion, less pressure on aid workers/caregivers), then the capacity wasn't so shrunk either. Too much has been cut and bureaucracy is way too high!
In irrelevant news lately, I've been constantly confronted by bureaucracy just because I don't count formally as a child within my family, which feels really weird while my siblings are just teenagers... invitations and rights for everyone but me.
If I read this like this @ewaldeng, my conclusion is that choices have been made in hospital care over the past few years (everywhere too) that are unprecedented, never pass capacity on to calamities, oh because life and health can be made. In addition, marketing and bureaucracy https://t.co/QdRfLDaU2d
@Franscanon40D Extending care remains a difficult point. How many IC beds do we want in the Netherlands for example? One such bed costs about 1 million a year. Also unused. And you don't have them just like that. Is it about people. And there aren't any. Less bureaucracy would help a lot.
@AxelLeReer @P_Bruijning With every other vaccine, research took just as long as it took for the corona vaccine. The other parts that go with it (bureaucracy, searching for finances, finding enough volunteers) took a lot longer with other vaccines. That's the difference. In addition, we had SARS-CoV-1 already.
@FleurAgemaPVV @telegraaf That is communism, there was always a shortage, officials, do not benefit from greater production, it only takes more effort. Waiting lists are a feature of bureaucracy, and none of the bureaucrats in DH who look up to it.
@ADPolitics @ADnl Still, these children are traumatized for the rest of their lives! Purely because the bureaucracy goes beyond humanity and standards. This should have been a harbinger for vaccination damage to mainly young people, even now only power and money is thought of.

@HenkSchraa @GrimbergenDA @JelleHijmissen @SHdeWilde The citizens of Lelystad also see this as bureaucracy...
@mike11891347 @mistermindset Exactly a toxic combination of all kinds of things: - austerity - closing down hospitals - unworkable bureaucracy - non-humanized care - shortage of staff - high workload - hands on the bed are not well paid - practically self-taught cannot be without training
Yesterday I felt pain and compassion, today I'm just pissed off. Piss on the bureaucracy and the lack of decency, humanity and help and excuses. Taking responsibility for your actions gives more respect than this filthy, cowardly, polished drainage.

I had wonderful days with the youngest. To a museum, to the oldest son in Groningen. I forgot that I'm sick and that's nice. Doesn't anyone take it away from me! But now I remember. https://t.co/y7YwNC2oaE
I had my first parent contact after one class in "my" class. I didn't even know most students by name. I had to take a tour in Antwerp, a city I had never been to. We didn't do half the tour. (4)
@EricaKarel1 @debroervanroos @VVD I do not understand that there are still people voting for that party. All the way to Groningen, the election results are at least eyebrow flicking.
Due to circumstances, I won't be able to participate in #Groningen next Sunday. Anyone who wants to take over my card? https://t.co/n22uxHsSG6
@mafdriver Actually, next to Groningen, The Hague is one of my favourite cities in this country.
@mafdriver And you will find something new and surprising in the city on every corner. Free expo in the library, tour of Amare, museum sculptures by the sea, museums, protests, markets, gallery Maurits van der Laar, cinema outdoors, warung mini.. too much.
In this call to the leadership of the Dutch armed forces @Kon_Air Force @kon_marine @landmacht do you want to stop your foreign missions and make the Netherlands your main mission? The Dutch people need you very much and quickly.

@gjvu That will end civilization, without infrastructure.
@life philosopher If humanity were to start over without any reminder of the knowledge we have now, that new civilization would have a different religion but would come to the same laws of nature.
@B11052307 Aha... Fox News. It will be. Civilization and shutting people out medically has never rhyme and still doesn't rhyme. Using children as medical shields doesn't testify to civilization either. All things a FOX news follower sees. You're not morally superior.
@overveenerick Bounced to notice that the layer of civilization is very thin and common sense often seek far. Self-thinking seems to have been lost after 2 p.m.
The whole white western civilization is one giant lie!! #WhiteWorld... #GiganticWhiteLie...
@2525 @gertjansegers @de nieuwsfor example You had to have a certain amount of civilisation to work as a presenter at the network. Now there are people walking around who do flat-floor street language and find it strange that viewers and listeners are not served by it.
@SophieintVeld Thank you! We want civilisation in Europe! The EU does not give a shit about human rights!

@Youssef_Kobo WE live in a Western civilization, headscarfs have been outgrown a long time ago.
It has come this far. @ZEMBLA about the disappearance of music schools. Civilisation is coming to an end.
@Hertog15 @Kariningroen @JoostNiemoller That you think that civilization says something about you again. That you first use and then you say something about "you"
@PlugHuig The Sustainable Development Goals 2030-2050 are a direct attack on the family and the entire Western civilization. SDG's must STOP! This is financed by our taxpayers' money, 700 billion so far rising to a trillion (bedr.+18 zeros) when it comes to Klaus Swab.

@LucSels could also have started by finding that academic institutions are places where theories that made colonialism possible have been legitimized or found their origins. https://t.co/whXUROL9DD via @global news
@ErnaaWagenaar @MarcCallaert @GreefToby @vrtnws That's called colonialism and apparently that's bad, but now China is doing the same thing and that's good. Soit, I don't understand anything about it.
@News hours If their own region had not been destroyed by capitalism, colonialism and imperialism, those people would not be here and we would not have these problems.
And here in the Netherlands crying about colonialism. https://t.co/7nmCgKN9sv
@SanderSimmelp Get that food away, I'm much in the green countries, also curious that they gave Crimea, by a drunken Nikita Khrushchev in 1954 to Ukraine after it belonged to the Russian empire for over 400 years. If Ukraine is depicted, that Western colonialism anyway.
The "good/bad binary" is really severely toxic because it creates these kind of aggressive mindsets in which white people think they are not racists because they are not fascists. Like racism and colonialism is something from the past that they are no longer part of. https://t.co/P6OLtQUcKn
@SylvanaBIJ1 What's wrong with something less cool and with shorter showers? What the hell is wrong with wanting to save energy? And why always bring that colonialism in? Of course, you can never have a discussion #growup #victim behavior
I've known this for years! New research shows convincingly that Black Piet is a fusion of different figures from ancient, ancient Dutch traditions that are not related to colonialism or racism at all: https://t.co/Dn6D6mrFrz
@SylvanaBIJ1 Case New Colonialism of yet another makamba. But my mother who wanted to go back to Aruba could not because the Netherlands did not want to reimburse her health insurance.
@walterpauli @VincentSchelti The attention then (and now) seems right. The world is a bit bigger than Western Europe. The (neo) colonialism was/is extremely important in the lives of billions of people. The struggle against it was crucial. Prashad writes impressive books about it.
@LOebeles @ArmenianRed @DRutgrink @NoryaMaria @SpaceDebatesNL @Sibruh The entire British imperialism... their entire economy was focused on this. Almost all Western countries saw colonialism as essential until after WWI.
@LOebeles @JohanRuiterRui1 @DRutgrink @NoryaMaria @SpaceDebatesNL @Sibruh How do you view ideological colonialism in non-Western countries, which is mostly happening now? So Western hegemony tries to achieve through NGOs and cultural war via the media/politics of those countries. Or do you also want us to become "savages" liberal?

@vanranstmarc @neyts_johan Immediately a splendor of a reason to take 'communication' more seriously, to make it clearer. Communication is not something that comes with it. It is necessary to clarify all domains.
@Rogier_de_Groot @Danny_T1981 @mzelst I agree. Therefore, I think that any communication skills left should be devoted to highlighting basic measures and booster shots.

@nrcombudsman @SjoerdvanHoorn Nou potjandrie, I totally missed this beautiful review! I'm at a panEuropean conservative conference in Poland (including Theodore Dalrymple, @HorcherF and @DiederikBoomsma). The question is: Where to go with conservatism? Actually, that book should be on reading list.
@nrcombudsman @SjoerdvanHoorn German Conservatism is thumb down. British Conservatives are nice.
@nrcombudsman @SjoerdvanHoorn O yes, the Konservative Revolution. But weren't those reactionaries and fascists? The Response wants to reverse the Revolution. Conservativeism wants to moderate it. And fascism is again a very different, much younger political movement.
@HendrKim @SjoerdvanHoorn Conservativeism and revolutionary drive are not mutually exclusive, Eric, as you know. #conservative revolution
@EliannevT if Sid lets his eyes slide along a girl's contours, expressed in a novel, he's a creep in cell, but that's not consistent with how everything is while it's a little faint. It might be his conservatism in which he can be bullied?
@LudditeHacker @SjoerdvanHoorn No way. Conservativeism is about resistance to major revolutionary projects, to caution and to renew traditions with an eye for concrete-existing communities. Libertarism, right-wing populism and vitalist nationalism (fasci... kuch) are other things.
@SanderSimmelp Socialism, femimism, conservatism, Islam, wok, everything is in it, with the necessary mockery. Thought to watch the movie in the Balie, but is now sold out. On the other hand I also found it too flat again
@CharlesUrbain Elchardus' ambition is not to feed the debate, but as an ideologist to guide social democracy in right-hand waters. Beware, his conservatism is not limited to migration, see his position on rule of law and human rights.
Dear @Bart_DeWever, through your different coalitions with the left-wing liberal trados, @de_NVA has betrayed the core of conservatism, community thinking, time and time again. Your philosophical words are unbelievable in the light of your actions. https://t.co/9NbPwMxzDq

This tweet makes it clear that the struggle of left-wing liberal EU politicians against Poland, Hungary and... has nothing to do with judges appointed politically or otherwise, but everything to do with the democratic choice of Poland, Hungarians and... for conservatism and Christianity. https://t.co/yanbjDuJBS
@EinsteinBarbie Fear. Fear of doing wrong where others are doing well. Fear of being laughed at or of people getting angry. Fear of being seen as stupid. That's actually always with new things. Conservativeism is fed by fear.
@johanhofman In this case we have a much better framework for discussion than the caricature opposition "conservatism vs change."
@Karel_DMeester @NederigeHop That's very short, conservatism has nothing to do with racism. BLM has an extremely left-wing reactionary edge and that's as rancid for me as it is for Schild &amp; Friends. What comes from those corners, rarely contributes to social improvement.
@LauraBromet @Ruud_Zanders That would ensure that farmers switch to organic farming. My question is more how consumption can continue to grow, so that the products are also reduced?
@FD_News Better! Then that consumer might stop over consumption of import products. They need to link to the Euro,Dollar or gold to that specification with the TL.
According to our calculations, Dutch consumption was more than 4% higher in September 2020 and 2% higher than in September 2019. The biggest catch-up after the corona crisis seems to have been made. #RaboResearch https://t.co/4TD2JzRLJk
@RiniVer @the_boerinneke @LauraBromet @albertboersen In the Netherlands all environmental requirements are met incl. sustainable, which is different abroad. Everything that is not produced in the Netherlands is less sustainable and worse for the environment. This applies to domestic and foreign consumption.
@Radboud_Uni Absolutely true. But the other side must also be named, 99 percent of the outside students leave after consumption of the study. Long term contribution to the NL society is therefore low (read negative). On the other hand, the housing shortage of NL students is structural (too) high

@CalzelunghePipi @SciteCito @LauraBromet No, problem we produce not for NL consumption but for the world. Unfortunately we export the products and catch the cattle farmer, but the dirt stays here and that is suddenly not the problem of the cattle farmer.

@Excelsiorden True story: in my puberty I called myself down because I appreciate the flemish culture so much.
Deconstruction is cynical in its core: if social reality is built from nothing but power, then power is the only thing it can change. Woke is obsessed with placing woke people in positions of power, under the guise of equal representation.
The purpose of the construction is to break down any form of meaning. Critical deconstruction is to unravel the power relationships in which social constructions have been created, to conclude that they are arbitrary.
Unraveling and changing social structures is called deconstruction and comes from postmodernists like Foucault and Derrida. It is a one-sided destructive process and a form of mindfuck.
Deconstruction or radical social constructivism: Social constructivism is an epistemic frame of mind that states that social reality is only constructed, it is not "real" and can change social reality by changing social constructions.
@dixit_guillermo @ShashiRoopram Only by destroying the dominant way of thinking (deconstruction), can a utopian world unfold (rebuilding).
@dixit_guillermo @ShashiRoopram Decolonization is the colonisation of Western academics with non-Western thinking. By driving away the Western ways of thinking (deconstruction), they agree to create a utopian academic environment in which all ways of thinking are equal (reconstructing).

@stapntap @italbers Fits logic in Marxist deconstruction? It is reducing society to anarchism; by removing all sociological strata and group rules. Social darwinism, survival of the fittest. They offer no answer. Nihillism.
@GeertsPieter @torfsrik See the reality as it really is. Not from the echo chamber of your utopian ideas. Marxist deconstruction is not liberation theology.
I'm in favour of the deconstruction of the known subject, but who am I?
A 'deconstruction'? Was 'critical analysis' not good enough? https://t.co/kWUI9nrxxv
Diefdag philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930-2004). He said that we can't fully understand relatively simple texts either because they always contain uncertainties and contradictions. Only by deconstructing the text can you find them and see what language does. https://t.co/JZepLrMc4N
@idaschrift It's even worse. How can a democracy still function if malpractice is not corrected? How can politics provide solutions to long-term problems when self-centered politicians without a moral compass are serving?
@PatrickWoudstra @jelmerevers @wskamphuis @Teachereninactie And then it got to the attention of the AOb. Because democracy, that's all very difficult. If you went to so much trouble to reach the top of the union, it's even the members who are in charge: never!
@WouterDeVriendt @kristofcalvo @AnneliesVl @Sophie_Wilmes Flemish interest exclude das democracy surely. That's called racism
@meuw @Life_s_about @GommersDiederik Threatening to kill people you're against; a real "democracy" that stands for #fvd scum. And then they quickly call others "nazis.".. Too crazy for words that.
@VincentVQ Fun, liberal democracy. I think you've suffered a psychosis by smoking too much.
@VincentVQ Idd @VincentVQ clear typo: replace democracy with dictatorship, and liberally you can completely delete. So you come very close to your constitutionally-violent monstrosity #vivaldi
@VincentVQ When "liberal democracy" is equal to being wok, then this is very good news!
@ZemmourEric @AngstigeHippie @DanilGonalves1 See Daniel, democracy
@BertLanghe Wait ff, I thought Belgium was a democratic country and so the people in se have the power... oh no, never mind, since winning parties are in the opposition and there is still a cordon plumbing, there is actually no democracy.
@demorning That has nothing to do with democracy act pure dictatorship
@AlwaysWhat @DirkVerhofstadt That's how democracy works: protecting minorities, and especially those with little or no levers to actively participate. That's what protecting and guaranteeing freedoms by the government is all about.
@VincentVQ Those who have introduced discrimination based on a certain medical status can no longer talk about liberal democracy and at the same time be credible. (I say as provaxzer)
@ZilteBotte @VVD That may be obvious by now. Rutte considers himself inviolable because he knows he is supported by the EU and WEF. Any kind of democracy is released. After the great reset he will get a nice, new position.
@mikevw1978 @geertwilderspv Happy democracy
@Zu_Demir Biggest capital sets the agenda; politicians can only nod yes and if that doesn't work helps some lubricating oil; then suddenly it does.. in Switzerland the people control the politicians and guess: the more real democracy the less corruption
Grandpas and grandmothers who want that from young children are creepy! https://t.co/imDMxTDWNJ
@ibrariemovic Ziyech went for 40 million, 2 years older, 2 years unplayed, injured. Is worth 10 to 15. Antony can be quietly 70+ for desire if he continues this way.
@RiniVer @DommeBoer @LauraBromet @albertboersen I think principles should also be realistic and realistic to implement. Theoretically one can think of a lot, but it must be practical, without turning the necks of companies. Applies to every sector, but from the farmer we want it.....

When you stop smoking you smell more; The autumn smell of trees is delicious and makes me long for the tree house of old. The smell of people is unbearable and makes me long for the tree house of old. Ergo, in the old days everything was better and I am looking for a tree house.
@petervmill You'd almost long for the scaffolding on the market square.
Believe doesn't fade the desire, but ignites it. - Thomas of Aquinas -
@cmfuentez A lot of colleagues have dropped out of care. Partly because of the high workload that has been going on for years. The bad payment doesn't give you a desire to come back. New people also see the mood hanging. To work a battle in the round.
@IkNet And if pricked side effects get vd prick or corona do they have the right to an IC-bed? And do they have to pay for their medical costs themselves, as some VIP pricked now require of the unpainted?
@Nora_D_L Makes me sad too:-( heartbreaking sometimes. You hope it gets better, but so far you don't see it. The desire is strong for times of old.
@Pension ghost I understand that extremely conservative ghosts long for that. The time of believing in a god was so much simpler than all those 'climate scientists' 'covidscientists'
@VeravanHaarlem The CWN was founded in the late 1960s by people from the Reformed and Reformed Church who long for more of the Holy Spirit. There is an emphasis on the work of the Spirit in daily life, a strong connection with the church, children and youth get a lot of attention.
@PieterOmtzigt @KremlinRussia_E @roelie_post @thierrybaudet @geertwilderspvv @harmbeterema @Henkrol Look. The SP has the solution. Gauw ff pay up and then ready. OKThe Mayor and aldermen, dominated by SP, cover the invoices for the Avatar sect. OK https://t.co/PemtE8GheF Best sectarian, by the way, to ask as a party to give up some of your pay... https://t.co/08Lgs6Qao6 https://t.co/CalUivuHuR
@JandlPaul @Boreout @stadjerA @JosKe1977 I do have experience. And you don't take parents out of the child. They are so loyal. And no matter how young they are out of the situation I think they always long for their parents. I think that influence is so enormous. In any form of assistance.
@LeonardvanGaal @lafreule Angry sister and brother-in-law and everyone knows that fear is a bad counselor. Do not have any confidence in the vaccine. By the way, the latter is justified, but why other desire to take that apparently ineffective vaccine anyway?
@NatashaHoein @youthcare failure Typically the @RvdK_minjenv We do nothing wrong..... duh art 1.255 development is seriously threatened... so safety invents the rvdk. It concerns abuse/neglect ed see EVRM/ivrk etc

63% of respondents consider it a worrying development when citizens switch from gas to wood stove. #consciousness #wood stove #gas prices #GasCrisis https://t.co/SeoM2GAjc5
@tijdvooreten @greenarkpress @hugodejonge I still come from the time that there was a pandemic at a death rate above 4%, although 7% is still behind in memory. Thought from a few billion years of development seems to me a reasonable percentage. Go fight against Nature!
That Boyan laughs his ass off with his 8 year project. Still in development. The only one that gets better is Boyan. Ocean Cleanup: making seas plastic free can be widely tested after successful test /via @NOS https://t.co/ioeHgkkoIW
@HesterLoeff My problem with the fine arts was that 'there was no line' in it because I kept doing something different. They wanted things in series, variations on a theme, so you could suspect a development or a thought. Unfortunately, after that one thought I had finished the whole development.
This is a good development: https://t.co/8vzCKQiB6H

Fenerbahce 2-1 Antwerp Ferdi continues its stormy development
@coco_riga Yes, endlessly chatting behind the developments (as a distraction what is really going on), while the attention should go to the planned 'Malburg pandemic', of which test and (danger) 'vaccine' is already under development.
@FrederiekevWijk @GeertenWaling @ZaireKrieger @DeBalie The enemies of the free word. A very scary development.
Dosing on stand. The need for large distribution centres continues to grow and this development is not going to stop for the time being. Too easy. If only it were as simple https://t.co/idtgN27Jua
I can immerse myself again for two days in playfulness and what this can mean in your development. It remains wonderful to experience how playfulness works and sniff up the underlying theory. Anything to grow you in treatment/trainings!
Whether or not to vaccinate? First, the basic question; what are the consequences for the immune system. Death rate less than 1% and then deprive the youth of the development of their defences? How big are the potentially disastrous long-term effects? They don't know, bet? #
