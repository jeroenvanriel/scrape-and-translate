@StephRumm Hopefully we can also vote for party (s) that take corona seriously but are against a coronapas. The current figures teach us that people with a pass also spread the virus.
@Ricardo72929206 @annstrijje You also uh, dirty crook of mine success with further spreading fake news and strength to your child!
@rooswibier @Onair58 Vaccines are less contagious. The chance that they get it and so distribute it is less. They get it less bad, so less pressure on hospitals. Now my son-in-law has to wait for surgery because IC is full of unvaccinated patients.
@VTMNEWS We from toilet duck are....After a week of spraying again in your toilet and some scrubbing... away are all traces from your toilet. Weekly, after week a clean toilet. All year round, lifelong. Just like Phizer vaccine, the glasses of your toilet can spread bacteria and viruses to your guests.
@Kath_74 @Do666999 @WaalsChris @vbemmelj Las last that the ics were full again 134 Corona patients of which 20% vaccinated. So small 100 people of 2million didn't vaccinated on ic. Well, on 2 million people not even noticeably... stop spreading disinformation.
@adegraat @Onair58 @RattusRattus13 Aar unvaccinated people do not enter hospitality, bios etc without negative testing and will not spread there. What vaccinees with a cough can do, especially in poorly ventilated areas without 1.5 meters away...
@WLMD @VvdF020 @mzelst @DiederikJekel If many people don't test, they don't know if they have corona, they probably don't go into isolation and they can continue to spread the virus. Also, there is no source and contact research possible if people don't know that they have corona.
@Elsingh1st @ThomasInLeiden @Diva_sWorld @Poisoni51179073 @deProfessional group @VaxxDoc @Doc_Box No one is a guinea pig, just like all other approved vaccines are the covid vaccines in phase 4. That piece of Twan was dated August 2020. What are you trying to gain by deliberately spreading misinformation? Cui bono?
@ADnl 'Propaganda: a form of communication in which the interested party tries to win supporters for its ideas. By deliberately spreading one-sided and/or invented information, it tries to play public opinion.'
@TrendNederland There are only 32 % vaccinated!!, but you do not answer the fakenews question again, so you acknowledge that FVD-ers are spreading that much.
@DieTukkerfries Then people didn't fly with @transavia to Marrakech to spread the virus
@CarlaWijn Untested vaccinees also exist. In fact, the majority in untested and the variants spread more than unvaccinated because there are more. I do not participate in that witch hunt. Life is full of risks and in my country everyone is entitled to the same care.
@Otualom @TwizS8 @estherouwehand @MinVWS I have lodged a complaint with the Municipality and asked to maintain it. Neighbors are not allowed to spread stench, smoke and soot? @estherouwehand #copd @Longfonds @air fund #open fireplace #allesbrander #unthinking or ordinaryegoistic
It means that the NIS has to stop spreading fake news. It's nothing new, every year since humanity's existence the flu comes up in autumn. https://t.co/rdr0iP8ZDR
@Truesoldier1 @thierrybaudet And quit testing I don't understand, because without testing you don't locate corona and it can spread uninhibited, which also applies to the uncontrolled running of vaccinees and not vaccinees. So what makes sense? (2/2)
@85BossLady ΕΚ Hm. I don't see any difference yet
@JurgenDepoortr @HildeDecleir001 There is still a huge difference I think, wearing a headscarf does not mean that you turn all your lessons into Qur'an lessons, you just teach and you have a head scarf on. Catholic education still obliges you to attend mass celebrations.
@arlennesten @vrtnws Infection vs (breakthrough) infection... is that difference known to you? Only slight symptoms... do you call that a breakthrough infection? The vaccines clearly do their job. Infection happened outside the hospital (may be difficult otherwise considering wearing masks in the ZH).
It was at 20:00 hours 8.7°C degrees, difference last hour: -0.2, rain today: 15.4 mm. For more information about local weather go to https://t.co/AMgqvKv3QC. #lopik #weather #weather

@Advocate_Sent @LeuvenCees id gender makes no difference, however it is necessary that all parties including GI hold it to concrete facts when losing 1 parent, if it can be proven that GI is not right there must be room for parties (showable rebuttal)
@JuliusCoachman Anywhere I go and that misery is on, I turn it off (if necessary) secretly. And there are just people who don't see the difference! I don't understand any of that!
@BrechtDurnez I know there is a difference. Was just a joke.
@doctor_devroey You don't know the difference between a pandemic and an endemic virus?
@NathanSamson1 @mobileevikingsBE @heytelecom_en With orange with difficulty 27 notifications. At Mobile Vikings more than 1,100. Looks like a big difference anyway.
@BjornBon @vanranstmarc @JaapVanDissel Who knows the difference between safety and false safety.
@RRoy9944 What's the difference between a crocodile? How greener how swimmer.
@LauraBromet @RijkJoost @Ruud_Zanders I think the difference is in the interpretation of the news report and thus the placed tweet. Sector approach versus "the farmer" as an individual and as a citizen. https://t.co/7fxDAEiDRY
@HighensWillem @Arnodg @Ruptrs @jpaternotte Ok, we totally agree on that. So it's a sort of "pick and mix"? Pope can't be missed either. The book can't be taken literally either. Is the only difference between us that you believe in a higher power? Can I live as well as you do without believing in him?
@MarionKoopmans Ach, 10 to 15% more contagious, the difference between extremely serious and crushing serious. What the hell, we're not going to do anything about it in the Netherlands. Delicious watching the herd immunity increase rapidly, while vulnerable and elderly, and children become massively ill.
Dear @de_NVA the flemish level, because of your failing Vlareg, does not exist for me. So a federal minister has the right to tap you. As far as I'm concerned, to fire you for not being able. Your ministers prove their incompetence daily.
@HanneloreGoeman @vlaparl @BenWeyts Incompetence of 2 consecutive Flemish ministers for education was enough to ruin everything.
@PynaertP @openvld @Maggie_DeBlock So stupid that she herself comes to highlight her incompetence.
@de_NVA @Yngvild8 A minister is not necessarily an expert, but is surrounded by experts to conduct as good a policy as possible. That one doesn't know that at the n-va we see Weyts, the incompetence that has become fleshy
@thomas_spaas Good that you posted the screenshot. I think it's a nice illustration of Rik Van De Walle's total incompetence to run a big university like the #UGent. What an undersized box glue ball, say!
@lfoquet I like to laugh with the incompetence of the people behind this.
@SincerityFirst @PVissers In my opinion, "the media' criticizes the failure of the government and the incompetence of Broekers Knol and shows that the refugees (e.g. those in Ter Apel) are the victims.
Mss should we start with our Minister of Education @benweyts.. When will this motion of distrust come about now? Rarely so much arrogance and incompetence on such a crucial function united. https://t.co/IEXbmJhSlN

@dbtibet Incompetence squared.
@cuirlaen @jdceulaer @BenWeyts Weytshoort not wrongly fluff his hat, agree. But he is not the incompetence in person responsible for problems in education.who were already current before his arrival. In short, away from the slogans.
A clear warning, but are "powerful lobbying machines, egos, territorial drift, defending the status quo and incompetence among some" another bold act? #covid19 #wave4 https://t.co/VIYAAgyLtN
@PJDeSmedt I have the impression that we will never get rid of the virus with this team, which is really the model of incompetence but which, against will and thanks, keeps the helm cramped, will never get rid of the virus. Vaccines would be the solution and by September everything would be normal.
@IngeMoerenhout "Advanced insight," Inge, not to mention... is typically the greatest euphemism one invokes, rather than "incompetence" or "incompetence".
@jdceulaer @BenWeyts As far as the incompetence of a minister is concerned, we expect a critical attitude from you and your colleagues. However, I do not think you set that bar equally high for everyone.Keeping schools during the pandemic became, and you know that, welcomed by many specialists.

@MarcLongin @GeertNoels @VanDammeEDU One of the main reasons seems to me to be the blurring of standards, the lack of respect and discipline among young people, which causes teachers to lose their grip on students with all the consequences which in the long term will lead to a fallback in enthusiasm for education.
@jpaternotte I just live healthy. It takes a little more perseverance than putting a prick in your arm. I know. The hospitals have been filled with people for 2 years without that discipline and elderly people, both with and without vaccine.
@Aboujahjah Those are rather punitive, dogmatic opinions, based on what...? I just started Elchardus' argument for less (Belgian) political liberalism, and must say, strongly supported by facts and logical analyses. No bad discipline to rationally support punitive language.
@WDooren @jdceulaer Respect and discipline were also invaded. Literally.
@frankhuiskamp Well I had too much time so Hyram's videos went binging and that piece of routine/discipline has stuck.

@demo_demo_nl The poignant thing is that we NL already pay 110mrd direct, 100mrd indirect taxes of 400mrd gross wages, we pay 49mrd care premium. And even then it is not enough according to DNB. NL breaks down tax burden, government attachment to economy is far too big.
@ErikSpierenburg @marckruijtzer @AvHuffelen @MinPress Yes man. The economy is still running well.
@KlaasKnot @WNLOn Sunday And yes, inflation is flying up. Wouldn't you like to settle? Would be so good for the economy. Serious? It's a race to more expensive. Buying power needs to be repaired: benefits, salaries up. Means taxes and products more expensive. Bring everything down!! Better
People whose political education began with their father who is 50% conspiracies spit and 50% pure facts are built different. By the way, 80% of those 50% conspiracies is just shit that the CIA literally recognizes in declassified docs, so not really conspiracies.

@rik_hendriks @ljmzwan @BenserWalt @OBraeckenssieck I do not bagelise anything. Yes, it is terrible for those who have been severely affected. However, we can relate. If you park the emotion and look at the figures, you can see that for this virus, the policy is not right.
What a crazy discussion at @NPORadio1 about the Netflix special by Dave Chappelle, who would be anti-trans or homophobic. Cabaretière who pulls up makes great points, opponent acts purely on emotion. He hasn't even seen the show completely @DitisdeDay @TijsvandenBrink
@wesleychadli @Arnodg @Ruptrs @jpaternotte No: the message is that emotion causes our misery. A pacified, emotionless society is then peaceful. Of course the leadership doesn't stick to it - knowingly - and that leads to the climax.
@JoostNiemoller @Randa1967 Mark means that at most he draws his wallet to take away our tax money from parents' emotions. @MinPress will at most investigate the exact number of the stinger. He is considering whether in 420 cases the removal can be "re-examined."
@dinoroorus @343Sander @Jinek_RTL @PieterOmtzigt He only draws his wallet to take away from our tax money the emotion of parents. He will at most investigate the exact number of the sting.

@IntoBits @parandanah Of course, flirting with danger is often the motivation, and that overlaps with emotion and love. However it may be; in my opinion, she has really lost all credits in her work and her interviews (on paper and spoken). I prefer to see/trust Stoter Boscolo.
@HighensWillem @Arnodg @Ruptrs @jpaternotte Isn't the message there exactly what can happen if you exclude all emotion? Even books, movies, art, etc.? How can a person then come to inhumane acts because of the protocol? A society in Orwellian style?
@matthias_somers Okay, fair enough. But inflation and unemployment have no link. Neither theoretical nor empirical.
@KeesScheepens2 @mariannezw Western science is based on empirical research. They develop and test vaccines on a phenomenon. While in my view man is a holistic being with a mind and a soul. What does a mRNA vaccine do with your brain in the long term? What does it do with your intuition?
@gevaxte @IngeStolkenburg @Mennooje1 @Fridayde13 @GVDBossche Have you also published publications of those who have been reviewed and so on. And also investigated with data (empirical). Or are they just stories of a few who like to chat on youtube?
@nicheje @fzwan @ArieSonneveld To give a good answer to that, I should indicate much more precisely what I mean, in such a way that it is empirical to test: who is "we," what is "visually set," etc.? So for the time being call it an unproven intuition or anecdotal evidence (N=1).
@mvanhout71 @WWieves @GeudensBob @dg_id That's the thing. That empirical research is not conclusive and is often suppressed by practice. There have been many instances of biases in this type of research that are applied unilaterally from the point of origin, where there is no double-blind comparison... ok. You can do this
@Stevenlemmens5 @Wwieves @GeudensBob @dg_id Is also not a question of standing behind anything. It is simply demonstrated in empirical research.
@Jurgenbolscher @LeoPeterzz @ChrisAalberts Your own empirical research is absolutely welcome, as long as you don't talk out of it. Wait I have a nice example:
@ecodenker @LouiseHoon Empirical evidence that free OV would simply lead to sustainable mobility is of course not there, just as there is no empirical evidence that paying or expensive OV would lead to sustainable mobility. That does not exist, because it is not monocausal of course, nobody claims that.
@Public Values Ah, but the SLB is an empirical fact, explainable by the fact that politics is failing. It seems undesirable to me to consider the SLB as a potential policy tool. Then you get professional autocracy (and a lot of randomness).
@AmitBadal Yes. Turns out from years of empirical research.
@Alice_VDE @Annabel57468925 @HoeyberghsJeff Uselessness of CST is both scientifically and empirically proven. Everyone around me is coughing and sneezing. Vaccines and non-vaccines. People are sick. Everyone sees it.
@SachaDierckx @LouiseHoon Modal shift is id crucial, focusing on more quality of life. What I miss in your speech is referring to empirical material. That's why I asked the question if there's one in front of frontrunners in terms of sustainable mobility in the EU with free public transport. I didn't think so.
@OM_OostNL Is there static or empirical research that shows that applying fast-track law helps to prevent new offences of equal order?
@harmbeterema @D66 @MinOCW @ivanengelshoven By the way, empirical research shows that the biggest diversity gap in academia (in the EU) is not between black and white, Christian-Muslim, native-allochtoon or male-woman but between left-right. Also a quota for right-wing academics?

@roos_zitman @RandySnoyl @SylvanaBIJ1 @lientje1967 The Scandinavian countries prove that women make different choices, there is more equality and freedom of choice, and yet women there still opt for women's professions more than anywhere else. Equal outcomes are utopian thinking, which is the point where left has flown off the bend..

@roos_zitman @RandySnoyl @SylvanaBIJ1 @lientje1967 The crux is humanity yes. Once we had no fire and were prey animals, man and woman have managed to grab it up to here. Nice piece of cooperation. Current equality bullshit is calling for preferential treatment..
@Annelieseken 35€ and tell him not to keep a girlfriend free. Message to my daughter was: pay yourself, boys don't get double pocket money.#equality
And implying that women cannot make that choice themselves is the opposite of equality
@EinsteinBarbie Are mandatory quotas (equality) in RvC and RvB equality?
@VincentVQ Democracy has its flaws. Absolute equality, nor absolute freedom are utopia. But in times of crisis, the adherents of totalitarianism are bursting into the hole. Let us control more freedom to bring more equality. Until the people say again: ENJOY!
@SchoutenLegal What is a well-functioning society? Is that a society where everyone feels equally comfortable and well-known?Is that financial equality? What is the role of government in this society? Is there a government that is equally trusted by everyone?I like to hear it
@LeendersGeert @DusauchoitChris @walterpauli @biekepurnelle You know that a female imam nt can pay with the death penalty. However, she stands for everything a modern Islam could be: equality, everyone welcomes LGTBQ as well. Why doesn't one put energy into this but in that headscarf?
@thijs_smeenk Ah what good to hear Thijs! Thank you! I continue to follow your efforts for more equality with admiration - and your other work as well. We speak!
In the name of 'equality' they then ensure that women, who want to give them more opportunities, simply don't get the opportunities others get because they have a different belief, something that doesn't matter at all if you give mathematics or something.
@anymorebrol So I don't get this? Equality for men and women but women shouldn't wear headscarf as a sign of religion that means a lot to them and what they often choose for themselves? Then it's no longer equality, kids, it's not that hard
We had a Youca day at school today and a man came to talk about discrimination, equality, racism, homophobia... What ironic, people come to school to tell us how to accept everyone, while they still don't accept girls with headscarf?
@EinsteinBarbie In compulsory education, equality and neutrality is more than desirable. So yes: no political, ideological or philosophical signs in compulsory education. As far as higher education is concerned: freedom &amp; happiness about your beliefs.
@geertwilderspvv I knew it! why do they never say the ethnicity of the perpetrators? to give right populist flank no confirmation? but we have the right to know who always does all this misery in our society 90% of migrants are men between 18~30 vol=full
@satefuta @NOS Now without typos: There is no connection between ethnicity and crime all that is wrong is your confirmation bias.
@RoelJennissen @irene_earshot When we throw it over that bow, I would like to add that I find it problematic that a new classification is sent into the world without it being based in the mountain on scientific research on conceptual entanglement of culture, language, ethnicity &amp; race
Racism is all the more reprehensible when Surinames or Moluccans etc are mistaken in the ethnicity of a Dutchman who is of mixed origin but is seen as white and is judged only on his skin color. Racists are everywhere
@roachnat1on Arabs is ethnicity treasure, you have white, brown, black, all diverse, so you're just white just not European white, white is wider than tattas, Asians can also be just white but of course with other features
@V_iswaker If there were to be an investigation into natonality or ethnicity of the people who come to the hospital with complaints...But there is not.
@jangajentan But the Azan shudders through the streets and the @police is mainly after 1 ethnicity. In the past luck was very common.

We want real diversity and that's why we have to pressure or deport people who have different ethnicities to another country. #Article23 Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it? Some do accept this logic when it comes to schools and modes. #Article23
@HistoricalNwsbl This is easy to trace from Das Kapital, but that text is certainly too complicated for Slaa, who reveals his obsession with ethnicity when he tries to analyze Zur Judenvrage. It is about capitalism as a religion in a secularising culture.

@DongaMaurits @PHB736 @NOS With regard to the transgender story, these so-called 'transrights' are directly against women's rights. They affect women's sports, they demand access to protected areas for women, and they claim prizes for women. It's anti-feminism.
@LeendersGeert @DusauchoitChris @walterpauli @biekepurnelle No, answer me now. And tell me why a female imam (who fights for feminism and equality between men and women) has a fatwa on her head?
Do you remember that Fransico of Jole (@2525) committed a #metoo and shortly afterwards was allowed to lead a debate about feminism (the organization saw no objection)? Why is his career not destroyed and he still gets a stage? Oh wait, he is left. https://t.co/1qYXTyYL7F
@TiliaVulgaris @Absolute Fascism and Feminism - they are all just perspectives with an equal claim to the truth. We only get further when we embrace this valuelessness. Individual perception should become the guiding principle of all things.

@BedrijvigeSaiga @SvenDeLoenen Thinking is too hard for people who only get their "education" from 1 particular environment. Then tell me why women do not claim their place within Islam? If the battle is about the headscarf in the outside world then they don't have time for feminism within Islam.
@Elvengast @jjvpeperstraten Self-initiation witchcraft is eclectic witchcraft, the oldest form of witchcraft. But Susan Smit has not initiated himself. That ecology has its roots in national socialism is bullshit. And what is the objection to modern influence edn asls feminism?That was badly needed
@SvenDeLoenen @BedrijvigeSaiga I also find it rather special that when I ask about feminism within Islam where women claim their rightful place next to the man in the mosque, I usually get blocked.
@Sanspareille @jjvpeperstraten Self-initiation* witchcraft, and there the argument starts to fall apart. The reason that these two nowhere find traction is because they do not exist in history. Ecology has its origin in national-socialism, feminism is another recent phenomenon.
@Elvengast @jjvpeperstraten Firstly, she is not a Wiccan following me, secondly, the initiation witchcraft really cannot be described as Cult of the Self. All religion or philosophy cherrypicks its way through spiritual history, most avoid feminism and ecology and that is a pity.
@Sanspareille @jjvpeperstraten Wicca is not a tradition but a New Age mishap from 1954, strewn with modern ideas such as feminism and ecology. It wishes itself a mystery cult, but cherrypicks its way through all kinds of historical traditions for legitimacy.
@anders_thinking @Elvengast @jjvpepperstraten Teresa even writes that unity can only be obtained by being in a state of grace through sacraments. I almost bet that these two have become popular in modern times because of a projected "feminism," "rebel against authority," and so on.

@brunostruys If you prefer your religion to a job, then you don't belong to the class! What's next? All women veil? How deep do you want to bow down to religious fundamentalism?
@biekepurnelle So they know what they're talking about...religious fundamentalism has no place in education
@brecht_jonkers @fonskedespons @brunostruys Nothing to do with fundamentalism? Is anyone who sees a barrier to accepting a job as a teacher rather than being open-minded or what? This has everything to do with Islamic fundamentalism.
@brecht_jonkers @brunostruys This has everything to do with fundamentalism. Someone who considers medieval, discriminatory, religious symbolism more important than a job in education has the wrong priorities and is unfit as a teacher.
@fonskedespons @brunostruys This has nothing to do with fundamentalism.
@biekepurnelle What a downright ridicul argument. It's not because we tolerated that 50 years ago that we have to do that today too. Whoever thinks a religious symbol is more important than a neutrality principle does not belong to a class. Religious fundamentalism can be missed as the plague.
@brunostruys If those ladies are eager to teach, then it shouldn't be a problem to respect the principle of neutrality? If they think that religious symbol is more important, then they should stay out of our classes. Religious fundamentalism can be missed as the plague.

@meralx @radio1be Hopefully never headscarfs in class. It starts with a headscarf and ends with the decapitation of another non-Muslim teacher. Have we really forgotten Samuel Paty? Let's never accept expressions of Muslim fundamentalism in our Western schools
@JuulBruijnincx @SalimaBelhaj A Muslim does not see that Islam is structuralally a religion that is an excellent breeding ground for fundamentalism. Catholics were also told during the Enlightenment that from now on Church and State were separated. Refugees think of themselves.
@RobbinHelmond Well actually I don't think it's even per se, but it's done out of Islamist fundamentalism (your attached icons), that's totally out of the question for me.
@RobbinHelmond The content of yours also escapes me. Something with'religious fundamentalism that leads to misery', you seem to aim at. That in the second picture of you is thus already not the case. In which the comparison with the first picture also goes a long way.v

@MichelleKuppens @Deniece_is_free @JoostNiemoller Actually, Michelle, you say that a woman comes out that she is a lesbian (or a man gay) this is not a tradition.... The tradition was denial and marrying to another sex. Also nostalgia and continuity disappears because people can and may be themselves. &gt;&gt;
Gay. Gay. Lesbian. Pot. I'm with everyone. And you? https://t.co/3eW0WgcjZX
@backvolgjake @Mocking93504540 ALLÉN the best should get n function,NIÉT because t n man,wife,gender,gay, lesbian,transsexual...and what seems to be even more of genders. Oh, I forget n Enuch...maw: ALLÉN the best, yet Jake, I agree with him...
@TheRightNL Are there any superheroes at this time who just have a fat... and just want a hot bitch......? Why all at once Gay, Lesbian or Bi?
@hanslaroes Well, it's not about her personally, it's about the law, about equal treatment of homosexuals. The king or queen should also be just gay or lesbian without having to abdicate thrones. It's relevant now because she's turning 18 and theoretically allowed to marry.
@KShithol @Ernie77354384 @markrutte Why do you call that 'frames'? There's nothing wrong with being a lesbian at all? I don't know if she's a lesbian, but why would she care and why would she be bullied? And I have shit on Rutte, but if he's asexual or gay, isn't that great?
@CieltjeVachter @de_NVA Curious whether Defi and MR dare to vote. In this one I am not blind to threatening relocation to France of halal millions of slaughter industry in our city. Like it or not, those animals will be slaughtered at 150km and consumed here...co2, JOBS,.............................................................................................................................
@switchinblades @Marcel4X @greenlinks Well, I'll give you the right one time there may be someone whose gender may not be directly visible, but this is really rare. Men and women really have enough external characteristics outside of genitals in which you can distinguish them.
"Bitches' means no respect for the female sex......- https://t.co/HXERWJEvej
@mwillemsen27 @Marcel4X @greenlinks You don't even know everyone's gender so you just say what you think is right and if someone corrects you then it's really no trouble to adjust the ff.
@HananeDeVos @godmiljaarde First sex and then drowned in that water sauce
@BabesNassira Have t really about simple things like, carrying gold etc that does vary by gender
@JanWillemFeith Yes. The straights who do not doubt their own gender or orientation.
@BennyBrodala @petervdv21 @jan_dhaene Sweetheart? Sorry no interest in other men. And if I'm interested in the same sex I certainly wouldn't like bitch types like you. Sure that booster shots are good for you, I'm counting on you to keep taking them!Good stuff according to the drug dealers.
@Sxlmaa_x What sins differ by gender?
@switchinblades @Marcel4X @greenlinks No because bass is a name it says nothing about someone's gender. And you can just change your name but then your genetic format will remain the same and you're still a man.
@PVerijke @Piet25051963 @akbaspinar I do not fight for religious symbols, I expect people to be treated equally regardless of their beliefs, gender, sexual preference, etc. Neutrality is cheap excuse not to do so. That's all.
E.g. if a woman listens to music or does not dress properly and a man also listens music and does not dress properly, they are both wrong. Both commit the same sin. The woman's sin is not worse because she is a woman? (And yes some sins differ is sex Iknow)

@LauraBromet @albertboersen The Dutch farmers have the smallest footprint in the world. But green left wants to profile themselves so they all have to break down. From their field of view... That cattle is slaughtered elsewhere in the world under grievous conditions doesn't interest them. Hypocrites
@RiniVer @DommeBoer @het_boerinneke @LauraBromet @albertboersen The Dutch farmers have the smallest footprint in the world. But green left wants to profile themselves so they all have to break down. From their view... That there is an alternative animal slaughter elsewhere in the world under appalling conditions they do not care. Hypocrites
@fransjackson @HaexMireille @klipc @margabult @mkulemans @volkskrant I don't come across the word mrna vaccine here. Furthermore, gene therapy doesn't involve the human gene. Genetically modified sunflowers also fall under gene therapy
@blckbxnews It's definitely about the syringe. It's a mRNA gene. Genetically modified gene therapy. mRNA gene in nanobots. mNRA that converts into DNA and attaches itself to our own DNA. A kind of Monsanto hassle but on the human race. That's definitely what it's about.

@Frutselmutske @_MMarijke Theorem: The older generation finds the younger generation by definition spoiled. And also believes that the music of the youngsters is worthless
@Claudje1234 @Diaantjebvv I agree that not everything is going as smoothly for everyone, but if I may believe our ancestors, it used to be more financially embarrassing. The younger generation is hardened mainly by means like mobile devices icm social media.
@keusmark @MinVWS have been vaccinated polio is as good as thrown out because people like me have taken the vaccine for it, many diseases that were deadly by my generation and older have been thrown out because WE have protected you and future generations by vaccinating us
@Krid_Voices Exactly! Building sufficient generation-4 nuclear power plants seems to be a better option.
@keusmark @MinVWS believing does??? what..and in the back will it be worth? because someone says that maybe and that even without siege says "the vaccine is going to kill you if not right then later" you don't have to have smallpox vaccine because I and many other of my generation are against us

@sdw Now just hope that this Macbook is not as gen. 1 as those first Intel machines, after 5 large replacements and 6 small repairs Apple replaced mine with 2nd generation model for free then. Hope that it is now good at once. But can't wait until I have it.
@RTLnews Last year this subculture of 3rd generation immigrants was still throwing street vowels at the police because they were tired of the lockdown. Maybe a good lesson to learn that in the Netherlands you can still do much more than in the rest of the world.
@MichaelFreilich @openvld Another generation or 2 and no one reads a paper newspaper...

@Martijn_Hofman @BartNijman No. It's why everything goes wrong in NL. Focus Rutte has been on pro EU enlargement, pro Immigration, pro Globalisation and now Climate. The basic agenda vd EU. Against the will of NL majority. Hence that all-destructive coalition compulsion. 30% benefits 70% is the shaak.
@JolandaVlaskamp Look at England what happens when you depend on globalisation for your supply chain. However, we also build the Netherlands and drive away the farmer. An electorate that is just as fragmented as the politics that governs a club of impenetrables in Brussels.
@JanLatten Globalisation has gotten the whole world mixed. You can NEVER reverse that anymore. With fear spreading and dividing in us and them, you don't solve anything. On the contrary, there needs to be a common perspective. Through the migrants can also develop poor countries, that damps population growth.
@NPORadio1 @2525 @de nieuwsbv What a crazy person. These kind of characters should be baked for life. - Fucking Christian? - Do they all want to die? - A gift from God? Is this an NSB-er or? Or just someone from the left......who has no idea of globalisation and resources.
@hollandswiefke @umarebru Truth finding is no longer necessary if you are npo, because you believe everything that has stopped globalisation in Rutte and Hugo to indoctrinate us and cheat #npo is #cheaters #mediavirus
@finhstamsterdam Noorlander forgets that as a NPO journalist he has a duty to inform citizens exactly what parties stand for. And not only to promote the same agenda as Coalition Rutte, nml pro EU, pro Climate, pro Immigration and pro Globalisation. Because that's what Noorlander does.
@Hvbt36Henny @huybertt @ErdalBalci9 It's a unique, unprecedented situation. But it's also a unique time. Globalisation, information speed, everyone knows what's happening on the other side of the world, everyone travels around the world, everyone can reach anyone: that was really different 20 years ago.
@JoyceVastenhouw With which cabinet is there no corona, high gas prices, immigration and globalisation?
@merlyntje @KAKKA_Dev O yes? With globalisation, capitalism and nationalism, I have NOTHING...
@tonfvandijk Ton, you are now officially among the middle-aged (or older) cstegorie men who think that everything used to be better and forget that the current conditions are completely different than before (digitalization, globalisation, social media, etc.). Something of apples with pears.
In 2013, Rutte's decision to further open the gas tap to cover the financial deficits of the Dutch government was largely due to the banking crisis caused by globalisation. https://t.co/l0Z0bnMFNg

@JustFunny12 Yes, we were talking about Scandinavia. The Swedes themselves are not happy with their country yet. If the Spanish government stays cool, I can sit it out here for a while. https://t.co/W1a8ua4Vk1
EU fanboy Rutte has also spoken again: the unelected European Commission must severely punish the democratically elected Polish government. This man cares deeply about his dear EU.

@Icetime2 @TheadeJong3 The government then! Not you!
@Icetime2 @TheadeJong3 And what does the fucking government say? See if there'll be a re-evaluation
@dvhn_nl Years ago already had to do in the R months. How many people + grandmothers and grandpas had people with underlying injuries were alive now. Do not doubt, wear that rag. For family, friend, neighbor and enemy. Everyone has the right to life. The government thinks miss differently, You too?

That buffer strategy in crisis management is, I think, a crucial element of his teflon layer. The first blow is rarely taken by himself, regardless of the seriousness of the mistakes made by the government. Rutte is not seen again until the worst thunderstorm is over.
@Frans_Strik @NPO1 By "unimportant details," I mean that our government and apparently an important part of the 2nd room find this... they let these people in massively. Or I misunderstand your last remark...
Pay attention: usually when the (demissionary) government screws something up, Prime Minister Rutte makes it very convenient for another ruler to speak first. So the alternative looks so uncomfortable: (via @ThomasHogeling) https://t.co/6MG3Mb5yog

@kgbvendetta @JPieters1976 @Nick_Wouters_ @FrederikVE @eva_vannotes Of course not. Nice legacy of the Church. Just like health care. But think that the RKK will die out in Belgium... You're not the first in history and not the last. But you've always been wrong.

My wife, with about 25 cousins and cousins, gets a small inheritance from Canada by means of a #cheque. Since this year you can't cash cheques in the whole of the Netherlands.
With donations on paper you can prevent children from having to pay 10 to 20 percent tax on the inheritance later. Huysgenoen @IrisBrik tells us more about this. &gt; https://t.co/AsYZMlivpq https://t.co/L3VlFQImcY

@DannyW_1968 First year I find reasonable but 20 months later is annoying because I am again the one who has to go after everything. Rest has received the inheritance but do not want to do anything for it.
@Innpeetersgmai1 Because our virologists and politicians are retarded, dictators are out for power, money, and have currently dug a well that they want to fill with money that comes from inheritance rights.
