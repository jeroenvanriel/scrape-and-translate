@Bartes73193791 I don't give in in this. Black Piet and Santa Claus is a legacy of our society, such as courses, football, scouts, bells or souls. I have NIKS with Santa Clause with Coca Cola on the back or Halloween and other wok U. S. import freaks.
It was a nice school but after the Easter holiday there was no need. So I went into the ASO to give history in four fourth years and three sixth years. Three weeks. That was extended until the end of school year. (2)
What a beautiful book it has become.The secret of Holland's history.And what a nice stories I have heard from the former employees present.Nice to meet these people who helped to preserve history in @Hembrugmuseum and now again in this book! https://t.co/j4reMX9lwD

@brennavanro Very big hate here to french so i get you ma aahhh history I always really see it as far away and I love it
Hey, you're gonna love history in asylum seekers.
@3eRuudie Unfortunately, there are more loose ends if that's stuck... know another teacher, history I believe.
@KrisRemels Nv-a is already history in 2024 as @BenWeyts @Zu_Demir or @FranckenTheo doesn't change the helm with bdw and weak Jan they never enter a government again
@brennavanro Ist clear roof like history do haha
@nielskalkman Toptip. However heavily confused by apparently my history https://t.co/VjgbR4LyLn

I know you don't have to judge anyone on their looks, but this little laughingstock would immediately cast you as a camp executioner for your Holocaust movie. https://t.co/DCIKJzcHZ3
@Peter_vd_Meulen @gherusselman @HiggensWillem @thierrybaudet No Peter, there are countless testimonials of survivors that indicate that the adjustment is the same. Same mode operandi. That you keep hammering on the holocaust really comes from you/your tube.
@thomashuttinga @sanverbruggen Ignorant of the upcoming Nazis, German invasion, Jewish deportations and Holocaust, WWII and 'liberation' by Soviets, followed by 45 years of communist dictatorship. All of that child could look back on that pram after 1990 as 60+ers, with little luck...
@HighensWillem @NerumWim @gherusselman @thierrybaudet I find comparing this pandemic with the Holocaust very stupid... Racistically I carry indetdywat through.
Ecclesiastes Jaap Dieleman:,,This is a plan from hell.,,You can't say it, but this is worse than WW2, worse than the Holocaust.,,There are reports that within three to five years all these people (vaccines, red.) will go to hell. • https://t.co/w27UiUO8dq
@NerumWim @gherusselman @HighensWillem @thierrybaudet Hey Willem, Think that by comparing the Holocaust and the current covid pandemic, he bagatized the situation in the 30/40s of the last century in a hurtful way.
The Holocaust and living in Jerusalem now. To cut Hitler off, they had many offspring in the 30 which I understood! That was a wonderful conclusion to this fierce story.

@JaapFriso Oh no! A holocaust equation. That's not done, Fleur "Thierry Baudet" Klein.
@JaapFriso @Roosindestad That call is justified. Look at the Squid Game and shudder. Still, let's stop dragging the holocaust into anything, just like the antivaxers do. That works counter-wise. Furthermore, all compliments for critical students like this Bussumse Fleur.

@judithdevries Judith when are you going to learn it now, the VVD-Dammer has nothing with or no problem with, surcharges, home eviction, debt problems ect. So the VVD will also in the future simply retrieve its voices.
@debroervanroos Yes but ff honestly, this is also a difficult one for Rutte, because he has his foreign I-are-a-important-world leader-pet on this, and this kind of little question asks for his domestic cool-land-with-apple cap, but then he has to go home because he doesn't have it with him.
And to think that there are also children of parents who stayed outside the #extravagance affair for the same reasons as those who are the victims of this #extravagance affair. It is high time to find out more about this too #extravagance survey https://t.co/1Qksrzx1JD

@haverkamp_wiebe Lots of blue berries eaten? Have you ever seen that when one eats roots every day, for months, the skin colour also turns slightly orange, with whites then pomegranates.

@Lichtboel @KeulenSjoerd @PlugHuig That some people think idd. What victims don't understand is that, everything is hidden away and they're already walking more than pack away 40 hair against a wall of corruption. I too know all about it. If you're not a victim, you'll never understand this.

@CoronaAttack @SamTheWise87 @qent2011 @PJDeSmedt Zeveraar. Every person who works has long had Covid. SELFS a hermit has a great chance to have had it already. Almost everyone HAD natural immunity. Now not thanks to the "vaccines." Stacking it becomes, they can sweep the vaccinees together.
@BartVeeken A happy person who knows that his cost has been bought.
@SweetLakeB @DeMeesterSjef @find_nl @Brenda108acjp It doesn't mean that you get sick right away. It can take weeks/months. No human being (read: immune system) is the same. Read the contents of the link, then it should be clear. Do more research and stay safe!

@PieterOmtzigt We no longer have human rights
@IngeStolkenburg @mgrigter @RiniVer @the_boerinneke @LauraBromet @albertboersen People have rights. I mentioned a few. And now you mention one that doesn't have as much to do with that AERIUS discussion as you do not live in the Natura2000 area.
@VrouwvdFreedom That's why an investigation against the Netherlands should be initiated immediately by the United Nations for violation of human rights regarding the supplemental affair! Today the witch Kaag was brought to justice for slander and defamation.
This register is a violation of fundamental human rights and will soon be terminated by the European Court of Justice or NL judge. Don't put your data in because with 1 kfk leak everything is on the street https://t.co/3MslsB0xwz

@SophieintVeld Thank you! We want civilisation in Europe! The EU does not give a shit about human rights!
@Onair58 And 1Today was busy again today. First the wappies that vaccinate children is against human rights and then Eerdmans was allowed to tell us again how awful refugees are.

@volkskrant We refer other countries to human rights and the rights of the child, while we are just as bad. Perhaps worse, because we are a 'civilized and democratic country'. #human rights #children's rights
@TijsvandenBrink @DitisdeDay @AnnieSchreijer @agractie Think it's money for the entire Dutch population. An investigation against the Netherlands should be started immediately by the United Nations for human rights violations regarding the premium affair!
There is no way that this deliberate violation of human rights has been known for many years now and that the perpetrators on all sides are being kept out of control.
Money through crime scenes and at work for crime at work and with all kinds of crazy crime and incompetence and as blocks between people and their human rights... also very consciously because they wanted to make money from something and lied a little bit for money
@EinsteinBarbie @LigentenRolf Victim's role refers not to being victims but to people who derive their identity from and exercise power over others by removing any responsibility for their own life.
@DekliegerErik Hmm, so much instrumentality in so little ideology (random) and identity: from extortionist liberalism to "mp" longest served to focus again. Take the speed of cognitive empathic perspective, where affective empathy lags. 1 to 1 charm tones. Tricks....
@RTLNL Why in dael or no deal that everyone in the picture has been tested against corona so you just make sure that people don't get vaccinated. It's important that everyone gets vaccinated and the media has to contribute a lot in that.
@iamER4SE @NOS I was raised by feminists who thought that was an insult to the woman. Were hurt, as it were. So you see how subjective everything is and how your identity cannot and cannot collectively enforce. I don't believe in transhumans. That's right.
@Assita_Kanko One of the rights in this country is to preserve the individual identity and even protect it. How is it possible that Muslim citizens are cornered about the right to carry what they want?

@prins_lennart As long as he still has the Turkish identity, he is also Turkish citizen. However, the demand of 10 years is completely disproportionate for the use of lyrics in songs. Hopefully the judge will take it off with a conditional sentence.

@bramcla And I don't know your ideology... but from your tweets I'm a little distracted that it will be a hautaine ideology somewhere, not something for burpkes like me.
@ADnl Wrong person with the wrong ideology in the wrong continent.
@brunostruys Get rid of those headback bitches. Get rid of the disgusting disgusting ideology..the Islam!
@telegraaf @wierdduk That's because these deep state parties see Muslims as assets and can use them at will to create fear or something else. Real Christians already have God's word guidance and not such ideology as left-wing parties.
@meralx @radio1be High time to ban that in that school as well. Get rid of Islam. Islam the disgusting objectionable ideology!
@madeleinemeersm @AyoubMilkyway @Assita_Kanko Don't break my mouth. How many victims has Christianity already killed, tortured, burned at the stake? Because the "pagans" had a different ideology? Because we should be right or wrong?
@ZihniOzdil @2525 To be honest, I don't care if they have been vaccinated or not, if they once renounce that violent ideology. Christian may then take an example from them.
@EA_010 @Assita_Kanko Not everyone but much. That headscarf is no longer of this time. We have already experienced such a similar ideology. Otherwise ask your brothers and sisters yourself. 20 years ago I saw enough cheering after the thousands of innocent deaths on September 11th.
@Youssef_Kobo There are those who would rather swallow up unemployment benefits than wear their headscarf, the uniform of a sick ideology, only indoors. Says a lot about the spirit of time.
@MiesBee @jeannemarian Meanwhile, they continue to commit horrific crimes against any kind of humanity. As quickly and effectively as possible eradicate that ideology, by any means possible! Bette Dam can also fight that battle without travelling to Afghanistan. Don't you trust her?
@dinoroorus @343Sander @Jinek_RTL @PieterOmtzigt He only draws his wallet to take away from our tax money the emotion of parents. He will at most investigate the exact number of the sting.

What is wrong? Because of its long absence the wolf is no longer native. It is unclear how the wolf came to NL, strange is that the wolf is not shy, while there are enough prey to be found in N2000 areas. https://t.co/pkn8EMd8DM
@iAnnetonly Sneaky I want one. If I ever have a (very white) baby I can rub them in the nose that that is certainly not an native Dutchman.

@meuw After how many generations are you native (and then both fathers and mothers should not be exotics)? Wonder how many Dutchmen meet that.

@Ruud_Brouwer @Dobbyde11 @wappiehoekje @jongeren_fvd And that policy is aimed at keeping communities (both native and exotic) small and weak vis-à-vis government and business.

@Ruud_Brouwer @Dobbyde11 @wappiehoekje @jongeren_fvd That indigenous people, according to the UN, also have the right to recognise and preserve their own culture, way of life and country. Or do you think this should only apply to people who are indigenous to areas outside Europe?

@BoswachterTim Haha yesterday one forest ranger vs the other. #teammoeflon #teamwolf wolf is natural habitat, native and protected, muflon has been introduced and provides open pastures. I think the wolf wins.
By the way Thierry Baudet @thierrybaudet @fvdemocracy the word native in the text I also have problems with that, you and Davide Heijmans are not native either (and not white either) but probably a mix of Dutch/Indian/Jewish (and perhaps still French) https://t.co/OAUZdeuG3B
@jongeren_fvd Thierry Baudet doesn't really sound native Dutch.
To put it bluntly, the Moeflon was imported, the wolf was natively hunted over the border 150 years ago. https://t.co/1bDPYS9Ehw

@fosgate112 @_MMarijke Again, not individually, if you move a lot. But cycling (to school, work, friends, activities etc) is good movement. With a more obese angry population you will see that introduction of electric bike kilos saves. 1 burger is also not a fatter.
It's bad that Union Berlin has to call their own supporters not to wear their club's shirt and not to go out in small groups or individually. All because of thugs who dare call themselves Feyenoord supporter... #feyenoord #FEYuni
@AfshinEllian1 @ZihniOzdil No, certainly not but in the time when the information can be collected for everyone everywhere and it lingers on listening to the wrong people or principles it is also reasonable that the community is NOT taxed and chooses for itself and not individually.
@DeUgelijke @VanderVegt1973 Quite sometimes. And each case is individually judged by a judge.
The rules of the game are constantly adjusted. It is not possible to prove on an individual level that you get less sick after the shot. The 3rd prick is still the prick that was already developed in Q1 2020, when science knew little about the virus.
So for you, the popular will prevails on the individual right not to be murdered. Good to know.
@LuitVeenhuizen @Ivdw5 @jantegiffel @lientje1967 Social, greater importance always goes for individual interest. By the way, just from Spain, the QR code for access to shops, restos does not apply, but that's what superstrict keeps the mouth caps. Well, get over here..
And what a year for Angelina Melnikova: Olympic champion with Russian team and now for the first time individual World Cup gold. Of course, no Sunisa Lee, Andrade, Murakami in this camp, but Melnikova is a good champion and with her appearance a figurehead of women's gymnastics.
@IkNet Less immunity from mouth caps is less people have had virus and will get it all at once (wave). It doesn't really weaken you at individual level. That wave can't handle the hospital again so: avoid that wave again with mouth caps etc...
@RotondeLLO @McMiek66 I will draw my employer's attention to you. Also nice that you can also participate individually and the price is also payable for individual employees.
@Daniel_Huizenga @KAKKA_Dev You'll find that only very exceptional, I always say, and I'm right, the anger, the violence, always comes from the left. Yes hitler was also a national socialist, read commie... it's (left) group thinking against individual right (if that exists) thinking
@inekeevink The sentiment is now that all these removals are unjustified, while it is not clear whether there is a connection to the surcharge affair. Caution is required, because the matter is often much more complex individually.
@hugodejonge @marije18412954 kw who are you actually. because you really talk nonsense. "they use them for population research" "individually this is not possible." because a population does not consist of individuals.? just nonsense, pure nonsense KW It is common that you can do a serological test individually.
@Fgandoul @egbertlachaert A somewhat strange discussion, because the individual right to freedom and equal treatment are also an expression of the will of the people. Also, who claims that the popular will as established in a democracy is not sovereign must show me the alternative.

What is our country other than a robber's gang where justice is lacking, people in this country are being destroyed for something they don't do, and Hoekstra's out there, they're gonna have to get his license right away, and not by the judge because that's a friend of that club's.

@MichielBrouwer9 @Lauwke3 @eevee_rose @HaHaHaGentherapy @DavevanOoijen @MisterRan Liberalism is not a political concept. It is an ideological concept.
@VincentVQ Liberalism, yes, what your party has to do with that is not clear. Too bad!
We no longer want economic liberalism, but a transcendent project is no longer there either. We have individual freedom, but to do what?
Mrs. Paul, that doesn't sound like a VVD sound, rather PvdA. Principles like liberalism; freedom of education and education is a matter for the parents, apparently have disappeared from your left side. https://t.co/yAKJrlp3z4
@VincentVQ Liberalism and Quickie (or vld) are not synonyms for me. I think of authoritarian, false democratic, self-enrichment and hypocrite.
Liberalism vs. community thinking is a false contradiction. You can perfectly advocate individual freedom as the highest good and at the same time stress that it is institutionally embedded in a society. Freedom stripped of the institutional component exists only on paper.
@MichielBrouwer9 @Lauwke3 @eevee_rose @HaHaHaGentherapy @DavevanOoijen @MisterRan Liberalism is more sophisticated than that.
@Nick_Wouters_ @JPieters1976 @kgbvendetta @FrederikVE @eva_van nuten Grapjas. A Catholic cannot be a communist. There is not only liberalism and communism. Those two excesses are inhuman. The human option is the social doctrine of the Church.

Liberalism is now taking as fast turns as legendary Chevism..................................................................................................................................................................................................

@B2TheT1 @Renaatjez79 @Oceans4U2 Also think it's your internal memory, heard more often that e.g. people with samsung a5 also had problems, that they got reported memory is full, but at @Renaatjez79 the app closes spontaneously, and that's weird.
@DeStralendeSter Nice and short and powerful. I've heard it 10 times. It must be firmly anchored in the memory. It's all a sad thing but the evidence surrounding the theory of a conspiracy is getting pretty tight right now. Thank you.
Hmmmmm..."exactly figure it out" with such a bad memory that will take a very long time again. Some awake MPs need help with that. https://t.co/Vnx7GKGuJm
@mirannepan Yes and then dare to say that rutte will find out well he already leads to memory loss and lies everything to each other with his robbers.
@tijdvooreten @greenarkpress @hugodejonge I still come from the time that there was a pandemic at a death rate above 4%, although 7% is still behind in memory. Thought from a few billion years of development seems to me a reasonable percentage. Go fight against Nature!
@Drklwrs @Karinvr066 @BenWeyts The parties of his predecessors are aware of no evil and also quite short of memory. The policy was intended to satisfy the domes and the parents, resulting in slipping on the pisa ranking. The class level was lowered, the chances of success maximized
@ilse_rid My memory works so that once I've read it it doesn't work a second time. I already know what's on the next page
@EelcoHoecke What does the people know? He's in his own fantasy bubble. Full of memory loss and invented results.
@parool Given his selective memory and speed of troubleshooting, these kids are long between 6 boards when he starts thinking about it again.
@Knack Why does Jambon feel the need to show everyone that he has no memory? We know that for a long time Jan
On July 14th... Who can remember that? Why ask after such a long time? I hope that people in Lelystad have a better memory than Rutte... https://t.co/21olJbceae

@LotteRuyten @municipal care This is how it goes: You build moderate infrastructure, literally drop the elderly so they have to go to a nursing home... Mobility is important and there must be good infrastructure and there must be good support resources available for less mobile people...
Once again, in committee, call for a mobility plan with "LydiaPeeters" for #zone30 in built-up area if it is NOT traffic safe for #cyclists and #pedescents (other than 50). Someday #road safety #mobility #Annickenergy https://t.co/loioBZ9rUP
Delayed traffic in the Rogier tunnel towards Basilica.
@WegWanManage @hajobeeckman @antwerpenize @Eneco We need to stop subsidising mobility Less subsidies for expensive mobility such as public transport and more control of traffic flows through charging. Rates are an important lever to play the modal distribution.
@Isoldevde Perhaps not even cleaned out for emigrated netherlands to the south of Ronse? But even apart from linguistics, lack of (work) mobility is a major issue in this country. After mentality also fiscal causes

@LauraBrome Summary I fully share: "For decades, they've been told what to do: innovate, feed customize, scale up, modern farmers. They think: we do everything that is asked, and it's never enough."
I tried it once stop but couldn't get used to it stop too modern for me stop I do wait for the singing stop https://t.co/Wmujkay2cP
Rotterdam often has that, thinking to do something good by bringing something modern, t starts to slide here but how do we ever get rid of that wrong infrastructure of traffic sewers, heavily polluting and unesthetic as the plague. https://t.co/YJGLhNpnEi
@WNLToday Because she has remained so nicely modern.. #ouwetang
@talithamuusse Buying no house because you compare with antiquity means regret in 10 years' time. Making choices: Investing is a dirty word, but only that works. Saving is stupid. Blaming the government is modern. Blaming people with money is envy. You decide to return your money yourself
@NolfJan @de_dijn is more complex than that. International case law adds the element of ultra vires. I don't know if the way we use our judges is in se so progressive or modern. Duranti would say to ECHR that it is based on
@ClarieMany @magnifiekZL What a fine tweet. Beautiful and much less modern (touched) than we think. Perhaps furious classic, determined by size and shape. Give it some time. The longer you look, the warmer the space surrounds you. Beautiful furniture and beautiful details (the stairs!, lamps).
@abrikozenkoek @HuyskensJohan @ThinkP @DVanLangenhove From Belgian law I have too little sense. We are going to see it. Agree to disagree, to say it in modern Dutch.

@MajestyCreation.. It can't be otherwise whether these elegant movements should also come in handy in other physical activities...
@NUnl On 17.5 million people these are not significant movements. A bucket with 17.5 million drops of water does not move if 10 go left and 1 to the right.
@MenrBen With patience it will be released in a few days due to your movements
The number of movements by truck trucks, inland waterway vessels and trains increased by week 41 compared to a year earlier. In the maritime sector, the number of movements decreased. This and more in the dashboard "Fast Indicators #Good Transport'. https://t.co/iSMvCRYiic https://t.co/cdxvGqQQMMv
Directional movements, it will also not be https://t.co/aENU7wH5ks
@DeNegering @hugodejonge I don't know. It seems to be true, so the information may be correct, but I noticed that the movements of the mouth weren't synchronised with what was said.
@tilunamode @wappiehoekje Oh absolutely. And somewhere it is sad too. Many of them go along in those movements out of fear or incomprehension. And these are guided by types who know damn well how things really are, but who take advantage of this fear. That latter group is very disgusting.
@Fregge89 @RalfCrutzen The Numa Numa Guy was also the idea behind the movements!
@Xooll5 @roelandjansen @nrc There is an opinion shared by certain movements in which special rights for minorities are sought. Surely that is not the same as saying that those laws are there?

@hansvantelling @hoggerwal We're still in the little Ice Age. It's just a communal process towards Ice Age. Like these kinds of movements in climate last 10 years or so. Look at history and you know what's coming. By the way, you always have cycles of 10 years. Now it's gonna get colder again.
@grazhdaninmira @PieterOmtzigt At the 2nd lockdown it was to counteract the travel movements of parents to school children. I have kids the only trip I didn't make was to school. Furthermore, I went to bakery, cheese farmer, supermarket etc
@3eRuudie White woman with Indian decoy and strange movements... she should be careful not to be abolished by the wokies. Cultural approval was it?
@YurreWieken Then you get de facto two movements in the farmer lobby: on the one hand "more at the expense of everything" (BBB) and on the other hand "let's develop with nature" (CDA)? Seems hopeful, but whether it happens? BBB shouldn't become too big.
@YurreWieken That the focus is getting wider, more pronounced and more clearly defined politically and that is generally detrimental to social movements where you want as many people as possible to recognize themselves in it.
How Angela Merkel betrayed the German people: always knew that mass migration and multiculturalism didn't work https://t.co/XqDR0PDpyW via @Frontnews
@cauwelaert There are as many communists in Berlin when they celebrated 40 years of DDR as multiculturalists now. Once the wall falls, no one turns out to be communist. In liberal multiculturalism people vote with their feet mainly.
@1970_R_Mat Multiculturalism is an illusion based on the irrational delusion that everyone is equal and compatible despite the many (often fundamental) differences, including in the field of development and civilization level, race, ideology, religion, beliefs, etc.
@RudieBdeV No. It's just gender shit, so-called sustainability, multiculturalism, squid game and QR code behavior. Language is of secondary importance. You just have to listen and learn to see who to listen to and how to think and do. A bit like IPCC does, say.
@actandevolve @BizzCreators @Stafke15 @jannydanssen That's a theory (importing a electoral audience) that I've never had much faith in. It seems to me to be a dogmatic issue: the belief in a kind of cosmopolitan multiculturalism. A painful inability to admit its failure.
@LOebeles @DRutgrink @NoryaMaria @SpaceDebatesNL @Sibruh @JohanRuiterRui1 So so noble, sincere and free your idea of multiculturalism is not. Non-Western immigrants are only accepted if they submit to your standards. Your hope is also that we assimilate as soon as possible as our economic position improves.
@actandevolve @BizzCreators @Stafke15 @jannydanssen That's only partly the answer. The ever-noisy adepts of multiculturalism will completely reduce it and people who criticize their cosmopolitan fata morgana want to talk to some kind of mental illness or phobia. That's a classic.
@wierdduk Then you assume that they see us as equal and not as someone to hate. Because often victims are now humiliated or ruthlessly abused. For many we are unbelievers or the bad white slave trader. Thank you left. Multiculturalism is great.
According to the MSM, right-wing extremism is a huge problem and multiculturalism is a blessing. We know better...
Leiden is a student city, with a rich history of multiculturalism. I therefore find that @GL_Leiden presents a completely white, especially male list with no running places for people under 30 shocking. What goes wrong here? https://t.co/Mpgskb8hAK
'Ethnic profiling' is a world-class bug frame that prevents the thinking of victims and innocent citizens from being collectively looked away from the downward spiral that has caused multiculturalism. https://t.co/pIl596g9Rw
Suppose the Netherlands became so extremely inconveniently polarized that it would fall apart in about two equally large parts. One high-tech, multiculturalism, liberalism, LGBTIP, QR apartheid and consumption. And one white, heterosexual, traditional state. What do you choose?
@Mercy44 And the cross on the Mite of the good saint?.. also gone,... Catholic schools.. also less... the Christian faith is supplanted by multiculturalism
@rechtselicht @lodenaken @standardmara @MmiraSam The ironic thing is that these left-wing guys will be the first victims of multiculturalism. Other cultures are much less open to homophilia, transgenderism, equality between men and women... They are actually useful idiots dragging into Troy's horse.
Ignore my motion about unicorns and alicorns being censored out of the street. They are paid by Soros anyway to spread left-wing propaganda. Have you ever seen an episode of My little Pony? Promote multiculturalism... Pfff! https://t.co/d2aDsCOY9l

Much has already been written about Rotterdam. The more we know about the city, the greater the need for a compact narrative. On 2 November 2021 the new book 'The Small History of Rotterdam' by Prof. Paul van de Laar will be published: https://t.co/YSuW24kQ3t
Just seen the movie again and it was so cool. So many details I saw more consciously by reading the books. It is such a faithful story and does justice to the books imo.

@bartvanloo Thanks for a fascinating story in the small but beautiful historical center of Saltleeuw. The Shakespeare of Flanders, or should we say The Low Countries, was well on the move! Still my book for signing certainly. We will have to come and see again.
I do not judge the content of the document because I have not seen it myself. Somehow the question feels very double for me as it is not just entertainment but a narration of the misery they have had to endure as kids.
